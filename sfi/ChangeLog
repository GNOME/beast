        * sfi/sfidl.cc: generate proper default initialization for sequences when
        @= is omitted (instead of segfaulting), FBlock support, cleanup: add name
        of arguments/arrays by the caller, not by createTypeCode

	* sfi/: new subdirectory and library. in preparation for SFK (synthesis
	fusion kit), this is the underlying interface library SFI (syntheis
	fusion kit interface).

	* sfidl.cc: .sfidl code generator by Stefan.
	* sfidl-namespace.[hc]*: auxillary files for sfidl.cc.

	* sfiserial.[hc]: preliminary parsing/serialization code.

	* sfiparams.[hc]: pspec implementations, corresponding to the Sfi values.

	* sfivalues.[hc]: wrappers for supported GValue types and implementaitons
	of Sfi specific value types.

	* sfitime.[hc]: some preliminary time handling routines.

	* sfiprimitives.[hc]: fundamental structure implementations, such as
	record, sequence and float sequences (for performance reasons implemented
	as a block of floats).

	* sfitypes.[hc]: miscellaneous type decls and yet-to-clean-up auxillary
	functions.

	* glib-extra.[hc]: GLib compatibility code, add-ons or extensions.
