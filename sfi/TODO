Interface integration work:

- move primitive types from BSE (GSL) to SFI (constants, notes, time stamps)
- move glue layer to SFI
- complete validation for records and sequences
- complete serialization code, split between values with/without pspec
- get sfidl to generate code into a different namespace
- deal with GValue returns of NULL in generated code
- handle non-validated sequences and records in generation code (things
  can be demarshalled in non-validated form after incompatible changes)
- nuke GError usages, provide logging mechanism?
- cleanup helper/util code in sfitype.h
