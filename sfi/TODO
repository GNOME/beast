BUGS:
- give _sfi_glue_proc_new() same signature as _sfi_glue_iface_new ()
Interface integration work:

- reduce function generation in sfivcall.c
- move primitive types from BSE (GSL) to SFI (constants, notes, time stamps)
- handle non-validated sequences and records in generation code (things
  can be demarshalled in non-validated form after incompatible changes)
- cleanup helper/util code in sfitype.h
- move BswLockFuncs into SFI, feature this with sfi_init()
- wrap sfi_init() in C API wrapper code
- sfi_pspec_rec should check that only sfi types are used 
- sfi_pspec_rec_validate should convert occuring enums in choices
- choice type should have validation function

BUGS:
- match enum names on word boundaries only

SERIALIZATION:
- serialization of homogeneous sequences could store the field type code only once
- typed record serialization needs to honour indent for sfi_value_store_param()

sfidl:
  fixes:
  - support N/A choice values, currently hardcoded for BseErrorType
  parsing:
    - plural generator
  code generation:
    - namespace substitution that works for both, C and C++
    - restructure name generation to example-based output:
      foo-bar, foo_bar, fooBar, FOO_BAR, FooBar
  C language binding:
    - review ParamSpec/Record primitive types
    - new enum syntax for value; nick
      YES,
      YES = 1,
      YES = "Yes",
      YES = (1, "Yes"),
      YES = Neutral,
      YES = (Neutral, "Yes"),
  Qt language binding:
    - everything

binary marshaller:
  - implementation
  - test
