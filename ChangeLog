Fri Oct 15 00:36:26 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* merge my changes with CVS (finally).

Fri Oct 15 00:07:17 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/icons/Makefile.am: 
	* beast-gtk/icons/Makefile.icons: setup ./icons subdirectory.

	* beast-gtk/bstsnetrouter.[hc]: new files (added some weeks ago
	actually), mostly reimplemented this file from the old song router
	code which is currently inactive. additionally to the routing canvas,
	create a toolbar from which BseSource objects are selectable (retrived
	through the categories).

Thu Oct  7 15:30:45 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstmenus.[hc]: deal with categories and not procedure
	types, feature icon specifications in menus.

	* beast-gtk/bstpatterndialog.c (bst_pattern_dialog_class_init): use
	new bse categories.

	* beast-gtk/bstsamplerepo.c (bst_sample_repo_init): updated
	g_pattern_spec* calls to match new()/free() prototypes.

Wed Oct  6 21:40:37 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* docs/bse-categories.txt: new file, giving general guidlines for
	category naming.

Wed Sep 22 13:08:25 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstparam.[hc]: completely abstracted the parameter
	specific packaging mechanism, we can now easily change this
	for tables or wrap boxes (yet to come though).

Wed Sep 22 08:37:39 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstapp.c (menubar_entries): changed "File" menu to
	"Project" menu.

Wed Sep 22 07:12:10 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstcanvaslink.c (bst_canvas_link_set_start): don't
	disconnect_by_func() for destroyed objects.

Thu Sep 16 09:19:54 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* configure.in: require GLib-1.2.5, Gtk+-1.2.5, GNOME-1.0.16.

	* acbeast.m4: added a bunch of new compiler flags, cleaned stuff up
	some. we still need a check to see if certain options are actually
	supported by gcc.

Tue Sep 14 00:18:57 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstzoomedwindow.[hc]: new widget, basically a scrolled
	window that features a toggle button in the scrollbar corner.

Mon Sep 13 15:58:42 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/gnomeforest.c:
	(gnome_forest_state_changed):
	(gnome_forest_style_set): new functions, we need to rerender the buffer
	here so the window's background settings take effect.

Mon Sep 13 05:22:37 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* configure.in (STRIP_BEGIN|STRIP_END): added GNU Make check.

Sun Aug 15 06:47:06 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/gnomeforest.[hc]: include gnome forest code for the
	moment, as it's not yet part of gnome (this also contains new
	libart portions).

Sun Jul 18 01:51:22 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

        * acinclude.m4
        * config.guess
        * config.sub
        * ltconfig
        * ltmain.sh: libtool 1.3.3

Sun Jul  4 14:30:03 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* configure.in: restore CFLAGS and LDFLAGS after XKB test.

Thu Jul  1 11:08:02 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstmain.c (main): use new keyboard stuff and guess,
	yes we are finally able to do that ;)

	* configure.in: check for the neccessary bits so we don't compile
	XKB specific code if the extension is not present.

	* beast-gtk/bstxkb.[hc]: special xlib code to figure
	keyboard type through XKB extension.
	
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytables.h:
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytables.c:
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytable-base.c:
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytable-us.c:
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytable-de.c:
	revamp, moved the common key codes from us and de into
	bstkeytable-base.c, implemented keypatch administration that
	features keyboard aliases and incremental usage of keypatches.
	the only thing we're lacking now is a GUI front end to choose
	the keyboard layout (and volounteers to contribute keytables ;).

Sun Jun 27 10:21:57 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* configure.in: provide program data dir for BEAST data files.

        * autogen.sh: invoke automake with --add-missing
        
	* beast-gtk/Makefile.am: autogenerate beastconfigpaths.h, install
	beast.glr.

	* beast-gtk/bstmain.c: read beast.glr from beast program data dir.

	* merged ChangeLog and beast-gtk/ChangeLogs.

Sun Jun 27 10:04:46 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstkeytable-de.c: 
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytable-us.c: 
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytables.c: restructured source files, more stuff to
	come.

	* beast-gtk/bstkeytables-us.c: vanished.

Thu Jun 10 05:00:26 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* configure.in (LT_AGE): removed that GNOME version 1.0.2 kludge
	which worked around broken gnome-libs versioning scheme,
	require 1.0.10 now.

1999-06-06    <timj@dhcpd7.redhat.com>

	* beast-gtk/bstparam.c: prepare parameters for wrap box container.

1999-05-31    <timj@dhcpd7.redhat.com>

	* configure.in: check for GNOME libs 1.0.2, since 1.0.6 doesn't really
	match gnome-config --version reporting 1.0.pre-2-10. gnome versioning
	is what is actually broken and needs to be fixed ;(

Mon May 17 02:49:23 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bunch of Makefile and configure changes so make distcheck works.
	BEAST package has version 0.2.0 now.

Sat May 15 23:23:05 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstsamplerepo.[hc]: adaptions so we can load samples from
	$(prefix)/share/beast/v0.2/*, which is where beast-data-0.2.tar.gz
	installs default samples.

Wed May  5 08:47:51 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstpatterneditor.[hc]: added drag selections, revamped the
	layout code completely. on the one hand this was long overdue,
	and on the other it was required for drag selections anyways ;)

Wed May  4 07:52:33 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* We provide som limited BSE Procedure support now, the
	next step is to dynamically create per-object menu's for
	for it's procedures. All BEAST windows should now have a
	status bar at the lower border to keep the user informed
	on procedure failures and similar things.

Son Apr 25 16:47:21 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* over that past 5 months, pretty much all of the initial BEAST
	code got revamped to suit the evolving BSE. apart from that, the
	code had to undergo some serious redoing to work with Gtk+ 1.2,
	the pattern editor is now only scrollable as a GtkScrolledWindow
	child.
	the old dialogs with static GUIs are gone now, we create 90% of
	the GUI from BSE's generic parameter interface.

Fri May 15 05:12:00 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* lotsa stuff. we have a ~/.beastrc now, a shel, a songshell
	and an instrument editor.

Mon Apr  6 19:36:45 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bstpatterneditor.h: 
	* bstpatterneditor.c: scrolling, keytables.

Thu Apr  2 05:31:37 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bstpatterneditor.h:
	* bstpatterneditor.c:
 	ok, we have the basic layout working now.
	keyboard navigation and note editing works as well.
