	got the first, real (though extremely primitive) synthesis network
	running ;)
	yes! that is *something* already.

	* beast-gtk/bstsongshell.c (bst_song_shell_can_operate): 
	* beast-gtk/bstsnetshell.c (bst_snet_shell_can_operate):

Sun Nov  7 03:06:55 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstsnetrouter.[hc]: ok, we can actually handle new links
	and sources as of now (bunch of code added to achive that).

	* beast-gtk/bstcanvaslink.[hc]: use names for the input/output
	sources and fields that actually make sense. reordered drawing code,
	so we draw stuff the correct way (from output to input).

	output sources.

	for all newly created canvas items, setup a signal connection so
	we can handle the link updating for the csources.

	* beast-gtk/bstcanvassource.[hc]: introduced ::update_links
	signal, to be emitted when the BseSource connections change.

Sat Nov  6 05:58:29 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstsnetshell.c (bst_snet_shell_build): moved most of
	the dynamic snet router creation here, we also setup the zoomed
	window in this place.

	* beast-gtk/bstsnetrouter.[hc]: changed matters, so we derive from
	GnomeCanvas now. removed other non-canvas dependant stuff (we still
	create the toolbar though). indicate toolbar mode through cursor
	change on the canvas.

	so they don't pop up in the toolbar.

	* beast-gtk/bstcanvassource.c: set/get canvas coordinate in bse object,
	we need parasites in bse.

	* beast-gtk/bstsongrouter.c: completely disable source file for now

	* beast-gtk/bstsnetrouter.c: ok, the canvas now actually reflects the
	real objects held in an snet. we also feature *adding* new objects now.
	the canvas apparently has redraw problems with newly created or
	destroyed items.

Wed Nov  3 18:37:17 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstcanvassource.c: don't accept NULL sources anymore.

	* beast-gtk/bstcanvassource.c (bst_canvas_source_build): fetch the
	source's object and only revert to BST_ICON_NOICON if none could
	be fetched. properly ref/unref the icon.

	* beast-gtk/bstmain.c (bst_icon_from_stock): stock icons stay alive
	throughout a programs life time.

Sat Oct 30 16:16:55 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	being perfect in appearance though ;( ).

	* beast-gtk/bstsnetrouter.c (bst_snet_router_build_toolbar): add radio
	for mouse_tool button (link, move, properties). (still all radio
	buttons selections are test buttons and non-effective).

	* beast-gtk/icons/mouse_tool.{c,xcf}: new icon mouse_tool, composed out
	of tigert's stock_jump_to.png, stock_properties.png and gnoghurt's
	move-tool.xpm (indicates link, move, properties for mouse
	buttons 1,2,3).

Fri Oct 15 02:47:33 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstmaster.c: wrapped up MASTER debugging stuff.

	* beast-gtk/bstmain.c (bst_parse_args): new function to parse

	* beast-gtk/icons/Makefile.icons: setup ./icons subdirectory.

	* beast-gtk/bstsnetrouter.[hc]: new files (added some weeks ago
	actually), mostly reimplemented this file from the old song router
	code which is currently inactive. additionally to the routing canvas,
	create a toolbar from which BseSource objects are selectable (retrived
	through the categories).

Thu Oct  7 15:30:45 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstmenus.[hc]: deal with categories and not procedure
	types, feature icon specifications in menus.

	category naming.

Wed Sep 22 13:08:25 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstparam.[hc]: completely abstracted the parameter
	specific packaging mechanism, we can now easily change this
	for tables or wrap boxes (yet to come though).

	* beast-gtk/bstapp.c (menubar_entries): changed "File" menu to
	"Project" menu.

	disconnect_by_func() for destroyed objects.

	* configure.in: require GLib-1.2.5, Gtk+-1.2.5, GNOME-1.0.16.

	* acbeast.m4: added a bunch of new compiler flags, cleaned stuff up
	some. we still need a check to see if certain options are actually

Tue Sep 14 00:18:57 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstzoomedwindow.[hc]: new widget, basically a scrolled

	moment, as it's not yet part of gnome (this also contains new
	libart portions).

Sun Jul 18 01:51:22 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

        * acinclude.m4
        * config.guess
        * config.sub
        * ltconfig

Thu Jul  1 11:08:02 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstmain.c (main): use new keyboard stuff and guess,
	yes we are finally able to do that ;)

	* configure.in: check for the neccessary bits so we don't compile
	XKB specific code if the extension is not present.

	* beast-gtk/bstxkb.[hc]: special xlib code to figure
	keyboard type through XKB extension.
	
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytables.h:
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytables.c:
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytable-base.c:
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytable-us.c:
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytable-de.c:
	revamp, moved the common key codes from us and de into
	bstkeytable-base.c, implemented keypatch administration that
	features keyboard aliases and incremental usage of keypatches.
	the only thing we're lacking now is a GUI front end to choose
	the keyboard layout (and volounteers to contribute keytables ;).

Sun Jun 27 10:21:57 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* configure.in: provide program data dir for BEAST data files.

        * autogen.sh: invoke automake with --add-missing

	* beast-gtk/bstkeytable-us.c: 
	* beast-gtk/bstkeytables.c: restructured source files, more stuff to
	come.

	* beast-gtk/bstkeytables-us.c: vanished.

Thu Jun 10 05:00:26 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* configure.in (LT_AGE): removed that GNOME version 1.0.2 kludge
	which worked around broken gnome-libs versioning scheme,
	require 1.0.10 now.

1999-06-06    <timj@dhcpd7.redhat.com>

	* beast-gtk/bstparam.c: prepare parameters for wrap box container.

1999-05-31    <timj@dhcpd7.redhat.com>

	* configure.in: check for GNOME libs 1.0.2, since 1.0.6 doesn't really
	match gnome-config --version reporting 1.0.pre-2-10. gnome versioning
	is what is actually broken and needs to be fixed ;(

Mon May 17 02:49:23 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bunch of Makefile and configure changes so make distcheck works.
	BEAST package has version 0.2.0 now.

Sat May 15 23:23:05 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstsamplerepo.[hc]: adaptions so we can load samples from
	$(prefix)/share/beast/v0.2/*, which is where beast-data-0.2.tar.gz
	installs default samples.

Wed May  5 08:47:51 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* beast-gtk/bstpatterneditor.[hc]: added drag selections, revamped the
	layout code completely. on the one hand this was long overdue,
	and on the other it was required for drag selections anyways ;)

Wed May  4 07:52:33 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* We provide som limited BSE Procedure support now, the
	next step is to dynamically create per-object menu's for
	for it's procedures. All BEAST windows should now have a
	status bar at the lower border to keep the user informed
	on procedure failures and similar things.

Son Apr 25 16:47:21 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* over that past 5 months, pretty much all of the initial BEAST
	code got revamped to suit the evolving BSE. apart from that, the
	code had to undergo some serious redoing to work with Gtk+ 1.2,
	the pattern editor is now only scrollable as a GtkScrolledWindow
	child.
	the old dialogs with static GUIs are gone now, we create 90% of
	the GUI from BSE's generic parameter interface.

Fri May 15 05:12:00 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* lotsa stuff. we have a ~/.beastrc now, a shel, a songshell
	and an instrument editor.

Mon Apr  6 19:36:45 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bstpatterneditor.h: 
	* bstpatterneditor.c: scrolling, keytables.

Thu Apr  2 05:31:37 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bstpatterneditor.h:
	* bstpatterneditor.c:
 	ok, we have the basic layout working now.
	keyboard navigation and note editing works as well.
