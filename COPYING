Most of the source code in this package is licensed GNU GPL or
GNU LGPL.
The respective licenses are shipped in the files COPYING.GPL
and COPYING.LGPL.
As a rule of thumb, plugins are licensed LGPL, BSE
is licensed GPL and beast-gtk is licensed GPL.
Much of beast, most notably generic GUI code, is still
licensed LGPL though, so in each case, the specific source
file's header should be consulted to find out about it's
license.
If someone wants to copy-paste code under a less restrictive
license, don't hesitate to email <timj@beast.gtk.org> to
ask for permission.
