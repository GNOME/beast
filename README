General Information
===================

This is a development version of BEAST/BSE, the BEdevilled Audio SysTem
and the Bedevilled Sound Engine. BEAST is a powerful music composition
and modular synthesis application released as free software under the
GNU GPL and GNU LGPL, that runs under unix.
More information about the project can be found at the website and
in the documents and manuals shipped with release tarballs.

In order to build release tarballs, you need Gtk+-2.4, a recent version
of the Gtk+-2.4 based GnomeCanvas, Guile-1.6 and the Ogg/Vorbis
Codec libraries.
Though optional, it is a good idea to also have libmad (MPEG audio
decoder library) around when compiling BEAST.
Most distributions already ship with these packages,
the sources can be found at:

GnomeCanvas (GNOME-2.0):
  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libgnomecanvas/
Gtk+-2.4:
  ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.4/
Guile-1.6:

Ogg/Vorbis (at least version 1.0):

MAD (BSE was developed against libmad-0.14.2):

The official ftp site for BEAST/BSE is:
  ftp://beast.gtk.org/pub/beast

The official web site for BEAST/BSE is:

There also is a mailing list for the project (beast@gnome.org):
  http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/beast/

And a related IRC channel:
  #beast on GimpNet (irc.gimp.org:6666)

BEAST also supports the LADSPA plugin API, so various kinds of third
party plugins can be loaded and executed by BEAST. LADSPA plugins are
available from:
	http://www.ladspa.org
and places linked there from. BEAST will look for LADSPA plugins under
lib/ladspa/ of it's own installation prefix, and in the directories
listed in $LADSPA_PATH.
