General Information
===================

This is a development version of BEAST, the BEtter Audio SysTem.
BEAST is a powerful music composition and modular synthesis application
released as free software under the GNU LGPL, that runs under Unix.
More information about the project can can be found on the website
and in the documentation.

Beast is a soft realtime application which needs elevated CPU
scheduling priorities. It installs a small suid wrapper which
acquires nice level -20 and then immediately drops privileges.
For Linux kernels of the 2.6.x series and later, this enables the
low-latency scheduling behavior needed to avoid audio drop outs,
this kernel series is therefore recommended for operating Beast.

In order to build release tarballs, Rapicorn-14.10, the GnomeCanvas,
Guile, the Ogg/Vorbis Codec libraries and libflac are required.
Support for MP3 files is optional and requires libmad (MPEG audio
decoder library) when compiling BEAST.

The web site, download and forums for BEAST are:
  http://beast.testbit.eu/
  http://beast.testbit.eu/beast-ftp/
  http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/beast/ (beast@gnome.org)
  #beast on GimpNet (irc.gimp.org:6666)

BEAST also supports the LADSPA plugin API, so various kinds of third
party plugins can be loaded and executed by BEAST. LADSPA plugins are
available from:
	http://www.ladspa.org
BEAST will look for LADSPA plugins under lib/ladspa/ inside it's own
installation prefix, and in the directories listed in $LADSPA_PATH.


Installation
============

Note that Beast has to be fully installed to function properly, and that
the binaries built in the launchers/ directory have to be installed with
permissions of the root user.
For generic installation instructions, see the file 'INSTALL'.
