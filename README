General Information
===================

This is the ALPHA version of BEAST/BSE, the bedevilled audio system and
the bedevilled sound engine.
BEAST is in very early development stage, the GUI is still pretty rough
and the BSE API is far from stable yet.
The rough goal of this project is to get an audio system that supports
multiple song and sample formats (besides the newly introduced .bse
formats) and allowes full fledged editing and manipultation for both.
Sample manipulation includes generation of new sounds from module
networks, based on subtractive synthesis.

To get a basic start, you'll also need the beast-data-*.tar.gz package,
which comes with a set of default samples, songs, etc...
