General Information
===================

This is a development version of BEAST/BSE, the BEtter Audio SysTem
and the Better Sound Engine. BEAST is a powerful music composition
and modular synthesis application released as free software under the
GNU LGPL, that runs under unix. More information about the project can
can be found on the website and in the documents and manuals shipped
with release tarballs.

Beast is a soft realtime application which needs elevated CPU
scheduling priorities. It installs a small suid wrapper which
acquires nice level -20 and then immediately drops privileges.
For linux kernels of the 2.6.x series, this enables the low-latency
scheduling behavior needed to avoid audio drop outs, this kernel
series is therefore recommended for operating Beast.

In order to build release tarballs, Gtk+-2.12 is needed, a recent
version of GnomeCanvas, Guile-1.6 and the Ogg/Vorbis Codec libraries.
Support for MP3 files is optional and requires libmad (MPEG audio
decoder library) when compiling BEAST.
Most distributions already ship with these packages,
the sources can be found at:

GnomeCanvas (use >= 2.4):

Gtk+:

BEAST also supports the LADSPA plugin API, so various kinds of third
party plugins can be loaded and executed by BEAST. LADSPA plugins are
available from:
	http://www.ladspa.org
And from places linked there. BEAST will look for LADSPA plugins under
lib/ladspa/ of it's own installation prefix, and in the directories
listed in $LADSPA_PATH.


Installation

Note that Beast has to be fully installed to function properly, and that
the binaries built in the launchers/ directory have to be installed with
