General Information
===================

This is an ALPHA version of BEAST/BSE, the bedevilled audio system and
the bedevilled sound engine.
BEAST is still in development stage, the BSW (BSE wrapper) API has
not really stabelized yet.
The rough goal of this project is to get an audio system that supports
multiple song and sample formats (besides the project specific .bse
format) as well as synthesis networks and allows full fledged editing
and manipulation of them. Sample manipulation includes generation of new
sounds from module networks, based on various kinds of synthesis.
More information on the fundamental principles can be found in the
./docs subdirectory.
Some *.bse files used for testing are also included in the ./test
subdirectory.

To get a basic start, you'll also need Gtk+-2.0, a recent version
of the Gtk+-2.0 based GnomeCanvas, Guile-1.4 and the Ogg/Vorbis
Codec libraries.
Though optional, it is a good idea to also have libmad (MPEG audio
decoder library) around when compiling BEAST. Most distributions
already ship these packages or will soon, their sources can be
found at:

GnomeCanvas (GNOME-2.0):
	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/earthquake/sources/libgnomecanvas/
Gtk+-2.0:
	ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.0/
Guile-1.4:

Ogg/Vorbis (1.0rc3 as of this writing):

MAD (BSE was developed against libmad-0.14.2):
	http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/

The official ftp site for BEAST/BSE is:
  ftp://beast.gtk.org/pub/beast

The official web site for BEAST/BSE is:

And finally there's a mailing list (pretty low volume) as well:
  beast@beast.gtk.org
send an email to timj@beast.gtk.org to get subscribed.
