DOCS:
- try implementing some kind of table layout for tsmview [timj]
- add QuickStart-Samples docs once we support sample editing [timj]
- turn off word-wrapping for normal files (e.g. /etc/profile) in
  tsmview. then, gsl-mplan.txt and NEWS don't need anymore markup. [timj]
- report mising underline to havoc, alper has a tsmview example in
  Re: uref macro, document font Date: Thu, 5 Dec 2002 00:23:38 +0200
- nroff files need another build step to get final page numbers [alper]
- the FAQ entry 1.13 has an anchor of #node-2-13-0-0 instead of #node-1-13-0-0
  due to unnumbered sections being counted as well. unnumbered sections should
  be counted seperately (e.g. as #node-u1-0-0-0). [alper]

SClock:
- incremental sort for median
- calc non-linear slope in one go
- new clock type that switches to linear once >QUEUE_LENGTH

Random:
- object tree backbone/trunk/tribe type for project, server and workbench
- item_get_toplevel() function for toplevel parent quries
- proxies get exported: if toplevel->use_count>0
- backbones exist only if they have a use_count
- forcefull alive keeping of objects if they have a use_count
- how export proxies of parents that don't have a use_count and are no backbones?
- emulate ref_count+::destroy semantics with use_count+::release? ala:
  - use_count prevents ::release emission
  - ::release on containers removes children
- implement remote use-count collection
- cleanup all glue generation code in bsw-shell
- complete and intergrate piano-script
- portamento-to-note in piano roll? probably need special effects
- bse_item_gather_proxies() could simply have container and child type (no callbacks) once midi/song don't derive from BseSNet
* move mix_freq and recording_freq into datahandle
* fix reversed data handle wrg n_channels
: propagate mtime changes through cascaded data handles (e.g. for dcache)
: gsldatacache.c: nuke blocks upon reopen if mtime changed
: clone handle caller must be fetched from stack

MEETING-RESULTS:
- piano and track roll scrolling implemented with secondary scrollbar
- piano roll dialog gains partlink property editor
- item links: (where (link 3 "TrackLink::LinkTrack::Cool"))
              (where (3 "tree:sopidgsdf:sdggsdf"))
              (where (link 3 "tree::sopidgsdf::sdggsdf"))
- prop flag: SFI_PARAM_SKIP_DEFAULT
                            
General BSE:
- object tree backbone/trunk/tribe type for project, server and workbench (treeroot storageroot)
- item_get_toplevel() function for toplevel parent quries
- level-o-meter visualizer at links (adjustable?)
  needs linear (red >1) and logarithmic display
- frequency shifter/multiplier (*2 etc.)
- fix fine-tune settings (from gsl)
- fix snet property changes in sub synth and instrument
- replace gsl_signal_exp2() with gsl_approx_exp2() and audio test result
- provide proper dB functions in GSL
- adjust stepping and type for all percentage settings
- alive keeping for waves which are removed, but whose index is in use?
- loading (restore) may only work when not playing (to keep consistency
  and avoid lock contentions during playback)
- during playback the instrument set needs to be fixed on a song  
- BSE_SOURCE_GET_CLASS (source)->remove_input() add GslTrans* so clear_input removes really in batches
- add pre-amplification (0..1) to freeverb for clip prevention
- fix scanner error messages for deferred channel resolution to include the *correct* line number
- fix update_suspension_state() recursion for ordinary cycles
- BseSubinstrument contains pixel artefact
BseWaveChunk:
  if (pos > wchunk->tail.end)                                   /* outside wave boundaries */
    {
      iter->lbound = 0;
      iter->rel_pos = wchunk->n_pad_values;
      iter->ubound = iter->rel_pos + MIN (STATIC_ZERO_SIZE - 2 * wchunk->n_pad_values, pos - wchunk->tail.end);
      if (PRINT_DEBUG_INFO)
        g_print ("PHASE_UNDEF, post-tail %ld %ld %ld\n", iter->lbound, iter->rel_pos, iter->ubound);
      return PHASE_UNDEF (wchunk);
    }
  the "pos - wchunk->tail.end" is wrong for direction=+1, should be checked only for direction=-1 and
  then affect lbound
* wavechunk, fill-block:
  wpos.loop_count = loop_count;
  dnode = gsl_data_cache_ref_node (wchunk->dcache, 0, TRUE);
  s/0/wpos.pos/ or offset
- notifier wakeup is disabled in bsemidireceiver.c
  ('cause gsl_thread_main needs to be replaced by bse_main_thred() or somesuch)

Snet Router:
- ctrl+move should clone objects (DND style modifier) 
- support selections for group moves
- add property editor dialog which contains intersection of properties from selected objects
- middle mouse button on canvas background should scroll

TrackView:
- resizable scrollbar
- context menu with delete, move, insert (double click inserts?)

PianoRoll:
- add to piano roll dialog:
  part-link properties:
  - loop-count
  - length (tact-entry)
  - part coment
  this fixes tact-kind queries for piano roll editing
  and song position pointer placement
- hotkey in piano roll to replay project
- piano roll: pasting doesn't quantize (without later movement)
- hscrollbar resizable (like cubase) or last-tick + 1 tact
- ctrl+move should copy (DND style modifier)
- draw ces and fes with red lines
- tooltip follows mouse and shows current note/tact
- hotkey fuer play song
- play notes upon insert (click on piano roll window)
- two notes from 0..15 and 16..32 look like one
- ctrl/shift modifiers for selection
- quantize upon paste
- fix hscrollbar  (BsePart end position implementation)
- select loop for playback during editing

GUI features:
- entry focus watcher: for property editing entries, do:
  ::focus_in   - set changed_flag=0
  ::changed    - set changed_flag=1
  _apply_value - set changed_flag=0
  ::focus_out  - only re-apply value if changed_flag!=0
- XFrames should highlight like buttons in EDIT mode?
- Module Menu: add EDIT
- part editor needs play position
- track editor needs play position
- Modul BseTranspose, inputs: frequency, outputs: frequency, property: semitones
- part-view: double click on list items should fire up editor
- BstToolbar, drop-down selections work only after button release
- support GUI info about what PCM device is opened r/w and about midi devices (some have just PCM)
- fix data cache seeks to skip the -64 byte offset at block boundaries

General BEAST:
* BLIT, band-limited impulse train oscillator
* object clippboard
* fade in/out of samples (sample editor)
- device monitor delay should be persistent in .beastrc
* get File/Save to work
* quit/close needs to feature mod-time vs. creation-time handling
* wave editor: provide transpose spinner for wave preview

sfidl:
  fixes:
  - support N/A choice values, currently hardcoded for BseErrorType
  - syntax for neutral values in choices
  extensions:
  - need support for real enums in bserecords.sfidl
  - choices need support for icons per value
  - choices need support for tooltips per value
  - signals should be specified in idl files (and have to be documentable)
  - procedure skeletons should be specified in idl files
  parsing:
    - plural generator
  code generation:
    - namespace substitution that works for both, C and C++
    - restructure name generation to example-based output:
      foo-bar, foo_bar, fooBar, FOO_BAR, FooBar
  C language binding:
    - review ParamSpec/Record primitive types
    - new enum syntax for value; nick
      YES,
      YES = 1,
      YES = "Yes",
      YES = (1, "Yes"),
      YES = Neutral,
      YES = (Neutral, "Yes"),
  Qt language binding:
    - everything
