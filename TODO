  Re: uref macro, document font Date: Thu, 5 Dec 2002 00:23:38 +0200
- what kind of texi macros should be used to markup manual page contents?
  could WRITING.3 have a set of default macros showing this? [alper]
- allow commas in @refBlurb{}, respectively Info BLURB = ","; texts [alper]

TODO:
- Icons: delete-track and delete-part shouldn't have the same item in track-roll
- Main: make beast recognize and view .markup files from the command line

  regardless whether the selected column is a note or event
- PatternEditor: Ctrl+R (random) should insert random notes or events
- PatternEditor: transpose script (up and down by semitone, so that we can use an accelerator)

- PatternEditor: play notes when inserted (also a piano roll TODO item); should be optional
- PatternEditor: channel based muting
- PatternEditor: allow combining multiple pattern editors (i.e. editing multiple parts which are
  played synchronously) spawned across multiple tracks - GUI idea: once selection in the track roll
  widget is implemented: select multiple parts, use right-mouse-button-menu, select pattern editor:
  combined view of those parts is opened
- App: closing the BEAST window should ask (close/save/abort) for unsaved changes
- App: file->save as should change the file name in the title bar
- Project: file open on an unmodified project should not open a new project window but
  reuse the existing one
- TrackRoll: implement copying of parts

- how export proxies of parents that don't have a use_count and are no backbones?
- recode hpack and vpack uses
- emulate ref_count+::destroy semantics with use_count+::release? ala:
  - use_count prevents ::release emission
  - ::release on containers removes children
- implement remote use-count collection
- complete and intergrate piano-script
* eliminate everything that fgrep -i fixme/hack reveals
* move mix_freq and recording_freq into datahandle
* fix reversed data handle wrg n_channels
: propagate mtime changes through cascaded data handles (e.g. for dcache)
: gsldatacache.c: nuke blocks upon reopen if mtime changed
: clone handle caller must be fetched from stack

PianoRoll:
- implement HFlip selection script
- play notes when inserted into piano roll
- change piano roll dialog wrg GDK_Escape (ala trackroll)?
- cleanup piano tick bar
- portamento-to-note in piano roll? probably need special effects
- add to piano roll dialog:
  part-link properties:
  - loop-count
  - length (tact-entry)
  - part coment
  this fixes tact-kind queries for piano roll editing
  and song position pointer placement
- hotkey in piano roll to replay project
- hscrollbar resizable (like cubase) or last-tick + 1 tact
- ctrl+move should copy (DND style modifier)
- tooltip follows mouse and shows current note/tact
- hotkey fuer play song
- play notes upon insert (click on piano roll window)
- ctrl/shift modifiers for selection
- fix hscrollbar  (BsePart end position implementation)
- select loop for playback during editing

Snet Router:
- ctrl+move should clone objects (DND style modifier) 
- support selections for group moves
- add property editor dialog which contains intersection of properties from selected objects
- middle mouse button on canvas background should scroll

Grouping multiple Modules in Synth Router:
1. copy selected modules to a new CSynth
2. delete selected modules
3. add SubSynth instead of selected modules, which uses the new CSynth

TrackView:
- resizable scrollbar
- context menu with delete, move, insert (double click inserts?)

SClock:
- incremental sort for median
- calc non-linear slope in one go
- new clock type that switches to linear once >QUEUE_LENGTH

General BSE:
- object tree backbone/trunk/tribe type for project, server and workbench (treeroot storageroot)
- item_get_toplevel() function for toplevel parent queries
- level-o-meter visualizer at links (adjustable?)
  needs linear (red >1) and logarithmic display
- frequency shifter/multiplier (*2 etc.)
- fix fine-tune settings (from gsl)
- replace gsl_signal_exp2() with gsl_approx_exp2() and audio test result
- provide proper dB functions in GSL
- adjust stepping and type for all percentage settings
- alive keeping for waves which are removed, but whose index is in use?
- loading (restore) may only work when not playing (to keep consistency
  and avoid lock contentions during playback)
- during playback the instrument set needs to be fixed on a song  
- BSE_SOURCE_GET_CLASS (source)->remove_input() add GslTrans* so clear_input removes really in batches
- add pre-amplification (0..1) to freeverb for clip prevention
- fix scanner error messages for deferred channel resolution to include the *correct* line number
- fix update_suspension_state() recursion for ordinary cycles
- replace Balance settings with 3d room position?
- BseSubInstrument contains pixel artefact
BseWaveChunk:
  if (pos > wchunk->tail.end)                                   /* outside wave boundaries */
    {
      iter->lbound = 0;
      iter->rel_pos = wchunk->n_pad_values;
      iter->ubound = iter->rel_pos + MIN (STATIC_ZERO_SIZE - 2 * wchunk->n_pad_values, pos - wchunk->tail.end);
      if (PRINT_DEBUG_INFO)
        g_print ("PHASE_UNDEF, post-tail %ld %ld %ld\n", iter->lbound, iter->rel_pos, iter->ubound);
      return PHASE_UNDEF (wchunk);
    }
  the "pos - wchunk->tail.end" is wrong for direction=+1, should be checked only for direction=-1 and
  then affect lbound
* wavechunk, fill-block:
  wpos.loop_count = loop_count;
  dnode = gsl_data_cache_ref_node (wchunk->dcache, 0, TRUE);
  s/0/wpos.pos/ or offset
- notifier wakeup is disabled in bsemidireceiver.c
  ('cause gsl_thread_main needs to be replaced by bse_main_thred() or somesuch)

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- optimize BseBalance process()

GUI features:
- entry focus watcher: for property editing entries, do:
  ::focus_in   - set changed_flag=0
  ::changed    - set changed_flag=1
  _apply_value - set changed_flag=0
  ::focus_out  - only re-apply value if changed_flag!=0
- XFrames should highlight like buttons in EDIT mode?
- Module Menu: add EDIT
- part editor needs play position
- track editor needs play position
- Modul BseTranspose, inputs: frequency, outputs: frequency, property: semitones
- part-view: double click on list items should fire up editor
- BstToolbar, drop-down selections work only after button release
- support GUI info about what PCM device is opened r/w and about midi devices (some have just PCM)
- fix data cache seeks to skip the -64 byte offset at block boundaries

Effects:
* BLIT, band-limited impulse train oscillator
- device monitor latency setting should be persistent in .bserc
- implement filters from http://www.harmony-central.com/Computer/Programming/Audio-EQ-Cookbook.txt
  (main source for http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net)

sfidl:
  - remove cTypeField() from cbase
  - typeArg(), typeField(), typeRet() and typeArray() in sfidl-cbase.[hc]*
    must throw an assertion for unknown types
  - typeArg(), typeField(), typeRet() and typeArray() in sfidl-cbase.[hc]*
    should be moved into the non-base class that needs them (i.e. out of
    cbase)
  - sfidl-manual.texi: complete the documentation
80- handle Procedure {} namespace in namespacehelper
85- rename nspace.printableForm() to something that expresses namespace relativity
  - bse-plugin-generator: Effect->Property structure copies don't work for strings (merely a pointer copy)
    (at least SfiRec will probably not do a deep copy)
  - reenable signals in bseprocidl
  - error "bseamplifier.idl:71: error: double definition of 'Bse::Amplifier' as same type" should
    indicate where the previous definition was
  - support Neutral choice values, currently hardcoded for BseErrorType in bseprocidl
  - choice type should have validation function
  - handle non-validated sequences and records in generation code (things
    can be demarshalled in non-validated form after incompatible changes)
90- finish Sfidl::CodeGenerator::rename (relative naming)
  parser:
  - sfidl-parser.cc: property keyword should be nuked
  - clean up enum code to use ChoiceValue value or sequentialValue, without
    doing computations
  extensions:
  - signals should be specified in idl files (and have to be documentable)
  - sfidl --output=foo.cc should be implemented
  code generation:
    - extra namespace for C++ client code
  C language binding:
    - NULL pointer handling is broken
  C++ language binding:
    - defaults for records (should be fetched remotely ; missing type blurb)
      what's "remotely" for types generated by an in-thread host binding though?
    - serialization: can we _really_ only use a template thing?
65     => reorganization of the createTypeCode function
    - should objects _really_ be values?
    - bindings lack testing.
    - records in bseprocidl: how can we figure out the type?
    - dynamic invocation interface missing in C++ binding (properties, methods)
    - later: introduce iterators into sequences
66  - createTypeCode refactoring
      funcFromValue, funcToValue,
      codeVCallArgs
    - should we have toplevel (unnamespaced) symbols?
    - should we have a "using Bse::Standard" (as opposed to "using namespace Bse")?

bseprocidl:
  - doesn't really work when it comes to implementing _some_ objects yourself
  - should output lower case vars (Info help instead of Info HELP)

STEFAN TODO:
  - BseServer::bse-preferences should be of type Bse::GConfig instead of Sfi::Rec
  - bseplugin.c doesn't use libtool properly ; probably gmodule should be ported to
    libtool
70- Bse::MidiEvent: should be wire-passable
  - Makefile.plugins doesn't get regenerated properly
82- C++ Classes _need_(!) documentation (i.e. Sfi::FBlock, Sfi::String)
  - add a dependancy to $SFIDL for beast-gtk/bstrecords.idl
  - rename bindings to client and core (instead of interface and implementation)
  - port arts driver from csl to port-audio
  - write port-audio driver for beast
81- freeverb parameters are broken (it _says_ dB, but it definitely _is not_
    dB)
81- compressor gui: http://www.samsonwireless.net/store/product.asp?sku=EM.CLX-440&nav=m
81- migrate artscompressor threshold/output to dB (keep compat code)
