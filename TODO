- registering the same script function twice triggers GType assertion
- fix procbrowser
- fix uses of gsl_engine_tick_stamp_from_systime() in bstwaveeditor.c
- bst_gmask should use typedef struct _BstGMask BstGMask; instead of gpointer

- move simple-source and spawning into sfiutils?
- fix time stamps
- storage: fix missing newlines when storing normal proeprties
- storage: data pocket: use typed serialization instead of #-hack for generic values

  can be demarshalled in non-validated form after incompatible changes)
- cleanup helper/util code in sfitype.h
- choice type should have validation function
- match enum names on word boundaries only
- serialization of homogeneous sequences could store the field type code only once

- BseStorage as object
- fix bseutils.c:bse_note_sequence_copy_deep()
- does BseMidiIController need a MIDI channel property?
- use procedure storage for undo or nuke the code
- (bsw-script-set-msg 'e "huhu") BSE-Message: while executing "bse-script-set-msg": Procedure execution failed
- bsemididevice-oss throws warnings when compiled without midi support
- song->master volume doesn't affect anything
- fix and canonify decibell naming everywhere
- need volume properties per track
- piano roll: pasting doesn't quantize (without later movement)
- initial piano roll popup should shift vscrollbar to around 50%
- pressing browsing hotkeys in release-notes dialog does stuff
- preference boundary values can cause assertions
- sample chunk display should show note names not only midi notes
- hotkey in piano roll to replay project

URGENT:
- support pspec groups in idl files [stefan]

DOCS:
- keep old news item links working after the site move (docs/cvs-news.html)
- try implementing some kind of table layout for tsmview [timj]
- add QuickStart-Samples docs once we support sample editing [timj]
- turn off word-wrapping for normal files (e.g. /etc/profile) in
  tsmview. then, gsl-mplan.txt and NEWS don't need anymore markup. [timj]
- report mising underline to havoc, alper has a tsmview example in
  Re: uref macro, document font Date: Thu, 5 Dec 2002 00:23:38 +0200
- @verbatiminclude doesn't seem to support makeinfo @value{} variable
  substitutions (alper, can you tell karl about this?). so i had to
  revert to an sed hack to make this work
- implement @path{} as @file{} alias
- s/Document Revision/Document Revised/

GSL:
* sample loader currently hard codes 440.0 for osc_freq
- [Stefan]  ?	LP -> LP transforms or zero/poles
- [Stefan]  2h	3-stage joining FFT code
- [Stefan]  ?h	FFT L-case optimiaztions
- [Stf/tim] 3h	CSL: whitepaper completion and publication

- [timj]    ?	WaveOsc: prop for stereo channel
- [timj]    ?	API for lp/hp/bp/bs generation from array of roots and poles

- [timj]    ?	in API and docs, s/roots/zeros/

Snet Router:
- ctrl+move should clone objects (DND style modifier) 
- support selections for group moves
- add property editor dialog which contains intersection of properties from selected objects
- middle mouse button on canvas background should scroll

PianoRoll:
- ctrl+move should copy (DND style modifier)
- draw ces and fes with red lines
- tooltip follows mouse and shows current note/tact
- hotkey fuer play song
- play notes upon insert (click on piano roll window)
- two notes from 0..15 and 16..32 look like one
- ctrl/shift modifiers for selection
- quantize upon paste
- fix hscrollbar  (BsePart end position implementation)
- select loop for playback during editing

RackEditor:
- covers are broken for rack-items close to right table boundary

GUI features:
- entry focus watcher: for property editing entries, do:
  ::focus_in   - set changed_flag=0
  ::changed    - set changed_flag=1
  _apply_value - set changed_flag=0
  ::focus_out  - only re-apply value if changed_flag!=0
- XFrames should highlight like buttons in EDIT mode?
- Module Menu: add EDIT
- part editor needs play position
- track editor needs play position
- Modul BseTranspose, inputs: frequency, outputs: frequency, property: semitones
- part-view: double click on list items should fire up editor
- BstToolbar, drop-down selections work only after button release
- support GUI info about what PCM device is opened r/w and about midi devices (some have just PCM)
- fix data cache seeks to skip the -64 byte offset at block boundaries

General BEAST:
* BLIT, band-limited impulse train oscillator
* object clippboard
* fade in/out of samples (sample editor)
- device monitor delay should be persistent in .beastrc
* get File/Save to work
* quit/close needs to feature mod-time vs. creation-time handling
* wave editor: provide transpose spinner for wave preview

BseWaveChunk:
  if (pos > wchunk->tail.end)                                   /* outside wave boundaries */
    {
      iter->lbound = 0;
      iter->rel_pos = wchunk->n_pad_values;
      iter->ubound = iter->rel_pos + MIN (STATIC_ZERO_SIZE - 2 * wchunk->n_pad_values, pos - wchunk->tail.end);
      if (PRINT_DEBUG_INFO)
        g_print ("PHASE_UNDEF, post-tail %ld %ld %ld\n", iter->lbound, iter->rel_pos, iter->ubound);
      return PHASE_UNDEF (wchunk);
    }
  the "pos - wchunk->tail.end" is wrong for direction=+1, should be checked only for direction=-1 and
  then affect lbound
* wavechunk, fill-block:
  wpos.loop_count = loop_count;
  dnode = gsl_data_cache_ref_node (wchunk->dcache, 0, TRUE);
  s/0/wpos.pos/ or offset
- notifier wakeup is disabled in bsemidireceiver.c
  ('cause gsl_thread_main needs to be replaced by bse_main_thred() or somesuch)

General BSE:
- level-o-meter visualizer at links (adjustable?)
  needs linear (red >1) and logarithmic display
- frequency shifter/multiplier (*2 etc.)
- fix fine-tune settings (from gsl)
- _SL functions have to be revisited and thoroughly implemented
- track_step_SL() needs bpm_tick => stamp_tick translation
- fix snet property changes in sub synth and instrument
- replace gsl_signal_exp2() with gsl_approx_exp2() and audio test result
- check for non-xref object links which should be turned into xrefs
- re-eval balance defines, provide just MAX_BALANCE
- provide proper dB functions in GSL
- implement ":force-dirty" hint (never skip save due to value==default)
- adjust stepping and type for all percentage settings
- get rid of BseSampleValue
- get rid of parasites by means of using data pocket and BseSource.x/y
- alive keeping for waves which are removed, but whose index is in use?
- loading (restore) may only work when not playing (to keep consistency
  and avoid lock contentions during playback)
- during playback the instrument set needs to be fixed on a song  
- BSE_SOURCE_GET_CLASS (source)->remove_input() add GslTrans* so clear_input removes really in batches
- add pre-amplification (0..1) to freeverb for clip prevention
- fix scanner error messages for deferred channel resolution to include the *correct* line number
- fix update_suspension_state() recursion for ordinary cycles
  
Old BSE:
general:
-	delay class destruction and plugin unloading through async handlers (slight timeout)
*	eliminate everything that fgrep -i fixme/hack reveals ;)
-	param_changed(): update modified stamp and record undo
Balance
-	replace with 3d room position?


sfidl:
  fixes:
  - support N/A choice values, currently hardcoded for BseErrorType
  parsing:
    - plural generator
  code generation:
    - namespace substitution that works for both, C and C++
    - restructure name generation to example-based output:
      foo-bar, foo_bar, fooBar, FOO_BAR, FooBar
  C language binding:
    - review ParamSpec/Record primitive types
    - new enum syntax for value; nick
      YES,
      YES = 1,
      YES = "Yes",
      YES = (1, "Yes"),
      YES = Neutral,
      YES = (Neutral, "Yes"),
  Qt language binding:
    - everything
