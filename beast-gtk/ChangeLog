	* bunch of Makefile and configure changes so make distcheck works.
	BEAST package has version 0.2.0 now.

Sat May 15 23:23:05 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bstsamplerepo.[hc]: adaptions so we can load samples from
	$(prefix)/share/beast/v0.2/*, which is where beast-data-0.2.tar.gz
	installs default samples.

	* bstpatterneditor.[hc]: added drag selections, revamp the
	layout code completely. on the one hand this was long overdue,
	and on the other it was required for drag selections anyways ;)

	* We provide som limited BSE Procedure support now, the
	next step is to dynamically create per-object menu's for
	for it's procedures. All BEAST windows should now have a
	status bar at the lower border to keep the user informed
	on procedure failures and similar things.

	* over that past 5 months, pretty much all of the initial BEAST
	code got revamped to suit the evolving BSE. apart from that, the
	code had to undergo some serious redoing to work with Gtk+ 1.2,
	the pattern editor is now only scrollable as a GtkScrolledWindow
	child.
	the old dialogs with static GUIs are gone now, we create 90% of
	the GUI from BSE's generic parameter interface.

Fri May 15 05:12:00 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* lotsa stuff. we have a ~/.beastrc now, a shel, a songshell
	and an instrument editor.

Mon Apr  6 19:36:45 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bstpatterneditor.h: 
	* bstpatterneditor.c: scrolling, keytables.

Thu Apr  2 05:31:37 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bstpatterneditor.h:
	* bstpatterneditor.c:
 	ok, we have the basic layout working now.
	keyboard navigation and note editing works as well.
