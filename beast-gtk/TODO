- song->master volume doesn't affect anything
- fix and canonify decibell naming everywhere
- pressing browsing hotkeys in release-notes dialog does stuff
- preference boundary values can cause assertions

DOCS:
- add QuickStart-Samples docs once we support sample editing
- make tsmview focus the TextWidget and not the location entry upon startup

GENERAL:
* BLIT, band-limited impulse train oscillator
* object clippboard
* fade in/out of samples (sample editor)
