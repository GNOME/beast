* pattern copy
* clippboard
* fix file selection (open load) dialog
* octave/note shift for pattern selection
* fade in/out of samples (sample editor & sequencer)
* highlight arranger patterns when played
* need play-sinle-pattern mode
* change default envelop to 0 attack
* device monitor delay should be persistent in .beastrc
* pattern-channel instrument selection should be persistent per pattern
* arranger paned to 50%
* arranger need sswitch to show pattern names instead of numbers
* arranger menus need to provide "change name" as well (especially f. groups)
* project playback can fail! should reset play mode afterwards
* add switch to set keytables directly, no-serverquery, which works without rc file

bugs:
-	select/none + select/invert unselects focus

icons:
-	need duplicate (clone) and duplicate-link menu icons

important docs:
-	sane default sizes for windows
-	write up basic blurb 1) new song 2) instrument+sample 3) pattern etc..
-	how to get instruments going in a pattern

general:
-	use auxillary window for bsepatterdialog?
-	get File/Save to work
-	quit/close needs to feature mod-time vs. creation-time handling

instrument editor:
-	prehearse fuctionality with spinner to indicate note

sample repo:
-	this needs to be essentially removed from bst* files

Pattern Editor
-	the popup menu should be attached/detached instead of the ifactory ref/sink pair?
-	user configurable toggle to start from 000 or 001 for row numbering
-	per channel mute. per channel in-use flag (bg-color?) (active when any note or instr or eff)
