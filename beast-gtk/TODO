general:
-	use subwindow for bsepatterdialog
-	item view should use destroy notification for bse container
-	need -Wshadow
-	need file-exists dialog
-	get File/Save to work
-	quit/close needs to feature mod-time vs. creation-time handling

instrument editor:
-	prehearse fuctionality with spinner to indicate note

sample repo:
-	this needs to be moved into BSE in a clean fashion

Procedure dialog:
-	optimize rebuilding, don't destroy status bar (this confuses the
	last-dialog keeping of bststatusbar)!
-	figure work around for button is hidden while depressed bug.

Pattern Editor
-	the popup menu should be attached/detached instead of the ref/sink pair
-	feature pattern params
-	user configurable toggle to start from 000 or 001 for row numbering
-	per channel mute. per channel in-use flag (bg-color?) (active when any note or instr or eff)

instrument editor
-	update the samples in the combo popup...
-	sample fetching needs to be moved back into BSE anyways
