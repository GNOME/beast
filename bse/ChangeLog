	* bsepattern.c (save_note): don't prefix seq ids with an 0, which
	would make them octal nombers.

Mon May 17 02:52:49 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bunch of Makefile and configure changes so make distcheck works.
	BSE is version 0.2.0 now.

Sat May 15 23:23:05 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>
	* bsesongmixer.c (bse_mixer_activate_voice): don't set notes on inactive
	voices.

	* bseeffect*.[hc]: started out on effect objects, they are fairly
	lightweight (and somewhat uncommon) objects, in that they are managed
	by BsePattern and in principle serve as simple operators and id
	containers only. the reason to implement them as real objects, rather
	than plain auxillary structures is to provide the convenient BseObject
	facilities, i.e. a generalized parameter interface for GUI generation
	and state restauration as well as basic locking facilities during
	playing.
	next step is to featured effects in the song sequencer.

	* nuked inappropriate ChangeLog stuff (about 15 entries over the
	last year). To sum it up, BSE implements its own type system now,
	which features a bunch of different fundamental types, e.g. the
	generic parameters, enumeration and flags classes, objects with
	single inheritance, multiple interfaces and procedure classes.
	the generic parameter interface is used to route most of the setting
	and getting of BSE objects through a central point, which serves for
	object state recording to implement undo facilities and to serialize
	objects (though there are some tweaks to that since we have to feature
	inter-object links in the trees). the type system is layed out in a
	dynamic fashion, so that new types can be registerd by third party
	plugins and get their implementation loaded (and unloaded) on demand.
	the basic infra structure for modular synthesis sources and filters
	is also in place, though BseSong doesn't currently integrate very
	nicely into that and it deserves some serious testing.
