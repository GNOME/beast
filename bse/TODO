NEW:
- get rid of parasites by means of using data pocket
- alive keeping for waves which are removed, but whose index is in use?
- loading (restore) may only work when not playing (to keep consistency
  and avoid lock contentions during playback)
- during playback the set instruments needs to be fixed on a song  
  
OLD:
general:
-	delay class destruction and plugin unloading through timeout handlers
*	eliminate everything that fgrep -i fixme/hack reveals ;)
-	optimize cross-reference removal
-	BseStorage shouldn't not contain type references above BSE_TYPE_ITEM()
-	param_changed(): update modified stamp and record undo
-	rework undo, gotta decide on what hirarchy and function level undo
	should be implemented.

-	to enable source grouping:
	sources need to disconnect their links ala xrefs, and need to notify of
	that *before* destroy is invoked.
	effectively, this has to work like as:
	channels installed on a source need to be xref-linked if the i/o sources
	don't have the same parent. if their parents are the same, we can simply
	have bsecontainer.c care about destructing those channels (as an optimization
	to keep xref-links low).

Song/Pattern
-	removal of instruments needs to scratch instrument references from all patterns
-	mutable channels! (make them silent)
	use procedure types for this

Identifiers
-	we need a string conversion routine, which converts invalid characters
-	there're some shortcomings in object namings e.g. "--- Minus ---" was
	not possible (there're also some bugs with making them into '_'s)

Instrument
-	smooth up the dot array behaviour, editing is somewhat sluggish
-	need to put envelope logic into a sperate file anyways

Loaders
-	we need AIFF

Balance
-	durch 3d raum position ersetzen
