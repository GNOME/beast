general:
-	rework undo, gotta decide on what hirarchy and function level undo
	should be implemented.
-	finish up the ALSA interface (especially before complaining about CPU
	usage!)
-	param_changed(): update modified stamp and record undo
-	instead of parser hooks, we need to announce per class try_statement()
	implementations
-	nuke BseText, or so...
-	BseStorage must not contain type references above BSE_TYPE_ITEM (cleanlyness)
-	maybe merge BseMaster and BseProject?
-	bse_object_do_store_private() should not save equally named params (from
	different heirarchy levels), actually this is a general problem with GUIs
	as well.
	possible solution:
	GList* bse_object_class_list_pspecs (BseObjectClass *class,
	                                     BseParamFlags   required_flags);
	/* how to handle groups here? */
-	delay class destruction and plugin unloading through timeout handlers
*	eliminate everything that fgrep -i fixme/hack reveals ;)

BseSource
-	passing history to bse_source_set_input() is braindead, should come from
	ichanneldef
Song/Pattern
-	mutable channels! (make them silent)
	use procedure types for this

Identifier
-	we need a string conversion routine, which converts invalid characters

Mixer/Sequencer
-	bse_mixer_add_voice_to_buffer:	balance asserts

Instrument
-	smooth up the dot array behaviour, editing is somewhat sluggish

Voice
-	we need refrencing/locking here, sample can be pulled under our ass
-	make sample_munk_index a BseMunk* pointer
-	substitute guint n_ochannels; q  guint         *ochannel_volume;
  
loaders
-	we need AIFF
-	we need .wav, desperatedly

loadwav.c:
-	read_data(): read sample data by blocks not as a whole

Balance
-	durch 3d raum position ersetzen

Munks
-	automatische munk berechnung durch frequenz transformation
	hm, koennte nen memory hog werden...

BseLfo
-	wave_form, speed, intensity, modulation (through other LFO)

Effects
-	there is no code at all yet ;)
	(take a look at the *.mod effects)
	pattern-break
	set-volume	(voice-volume)
	vibrato
	-	buffer-sync
	-	lfo as freq-mod
	tremolo
	-	buffer-sync
	-	lfo as freq-mod

	fine-tune
	-	1/24 of halftone

	pitch-bend
	-	slides
	
	portamento
	-	nahtloser uebergang zur naechsten note
	-	buffer-sync
