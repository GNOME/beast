- partials context creation for non-modifiable snets:
  gsl-module: BseContextBus 4in<->4out
  BseSource: BseContextIBus (owns ContextBus) 4in, BseContextOBus 4out
- sub-synth must handle property changes correctly:
  void bse_snet_set_iport_dest (BseSNet        *snet,
                                const gchar    *port_name,
                                guint		snet_context,
                                GslModule      *imodule,
                                guint           istream,
                                GslTrans       *trans);
  void bse_snet_set_iport_src  (BseSNet        *snet,
                                const gchar    *port_name,
                                guint           snet_context,
                                GslModule      *omodule,
                                guint           ostream,
                                GslTrans       *trans);
  plus s/iport/oport/                                

- fixed amount of contexts (notes) per instrument as song property
- BseDisconnectSource with two engine modules
- user process collection of done modules + state reset
Problems:
- _SL functions have to be revisited and thoroughly implemented
- track_step_SL() needs bpm_tick => stamp_tick translation
- multi-channel/note/instantiation???

NEW:
- get rid of parasites by means of using data pocket
- alive keeping for waves which are removed, but whose index is in use?
- loading (restore) may only work when not playing (to keep consistency
  and avoid lock contentions during playback)
- during playback the set instruments needs to be fixed on a song  
  
OLD:
general:
-	delay class destruction and plugin unloading through timeout handlers
*	eliminate everything that fgrep -i fixme/hack reveals ;)
-	optimize cross-reference removal
-	BseStorage shouldn't not contain type references above BSE_TYPE_ITEM()
-	param_changed(): update modified stamp and record undo
-	rework undo, gotta decide on what hirarchy and function level undo
	should be implemented.

-	to enable source grouping:
	sources need to disconnect their links ala xrefs, and need to notify of
	that *before* destroy is invoked.
	effectively, this has to work like as:
	channels installed on a source need to be xref-linked if the i/o sources
	don't have the same parent. if their parents are the same, we can simply
	have bsecontainer.c care about destructing those channels (as an optimization
	to keep xref-links low).

Song/Pattern
-	removal of instruments needs to scratch instrument references from all patterns
-	mutable channels! (make them silent)
	use procedure types for this

Identifiers
-	we need a string conversion routine, which converts invalid characters
-	there're some shortcomings in object namings e.g. "--- Minus ---" was
	not possible (there're also some bugs with making them into '_'s)

Instrument
-	smooth up the dot array behaviour, editing is somewhat sluggish
-	need to put envelope logic into a sperate file anyways

Loaders
-	we need AIFF

Balance
-	durch 3d raum position ersetzen

Effects
-	there is no code at all yet ;)
	(take a look at the *.mod effects)
	pattern-break
	set-volume	(voice-volume)
	vibrato
	-	buffer-sync
	-	lfo as freq-mod
	tremolo
	-	buffer-sync
	-	lfo as freq-mod
	fine-tune
	-	1/24 of halftone
	pitch-bend
	-	slides
	portamento (up/down/to note)
	-	nahtloser uebergang zur naechsten note
	-	buffer-sync
