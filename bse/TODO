* nuke ::destroy. use dispose or finalize for objects.
* introduce ::unparanted for items (convenience).
  item usage from outside:
  {
    use (item);
    connect (item, ::unparanted);
    do stuff with item.
    disconnect (item, ::unparanted);
    unuse (item);
  }
  or
  {
    use (item);
    connect (item, ::unparanted);
    do stuff with item.
  }
  upon ::unparanted:
  {
    disconnect (item, ::unparanted);
    unuse (item);
  }

- get rid of ulongs (for types), make all types strings
- fix fine-tune settings (from gsl)
- partial context creation for non-modifiable snets (songs):
  gsl-module: BseContextBus 4in<->4out
  BseSource: BseContextIBus (owns ContextBus) 4in, BseContextOBus 4out
- BseDisconnectSource with two engine modules
(- fixed amount of contexts (notes) per instrument as song property?)
- user process collection of done modules + state reset
Problems:
- _SL functions have to be revisited and thoroughly implemented
- track_step_SL() needs bpm_tick => stamp_tick translation
- multi-channel/note/instantiation???
- fix context creation recursion in subsynth
- fix snet propety changes in sub synth and instrument
- replace gsl_signal_exp2() with gsl_approx_exp2() and audio test result

NEW:
- re-eval balance defines, provide just MAX_BALANCE
- provide proper dB functions in GSL
- implement BSE_PARAM_FORCE_DIRTY (never skip save due to value==default)
- adjust stepping and type for all percentage settings
- get rid of BseSampleValue
- get rid of parasites by means of using data pocket
- alive keeping for waves which are removed, but whose index is in use?
- loading (restore) may only work when not playing (to keep consistency
  and avoid lock contentions during playback)
- during playback the instrument set needs to be fixed on a song  
- BSE_SOURCE_GET_CLASS (source)->remove_input() add GslTrans* so clear_input removes really in batches
- add pre-amplification (0..1) to freeverb for clip prevention
  
OLD:
general:
-	delay class destruction and plugin unloading through timeout handlers
*	eliminate everything that fgrep -i fixme/hack reveals ;)
-	optimize cross-reference removal
-	param_changed(): update modified stamp and record undo
-	rework undo, gotta decide on what hirarchy and function level undo
	should be implemented.

-	to enable source grouping:
	sources need to disconnect their links ala xrefs, and need to notify of
	that *before* destroy is invoked.
	effectively, this has to work like:
	channels installed on a source need to be xref-linked if the i/o sources
	don't have the same parent. if their parents are the same, we can simply
	have bsecontainer.c care about destructing those channels (as an optimization
	to keep xref-links low).

Instrument
-	smooth up the dot array behaviour, editing is somewhat sluggish
-	need to put envelope logic into a sperate file anyways

Song/Pattern
-	removal of instruments needs to scratch instrument references from all patterns
-	mutable channels! (make them silent)
	use procedure types for this

Balance
-	replace with 3d room position?
