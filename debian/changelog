beast (0.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * sfi/sfithreads.c:
    + Replaced a _syscall0() declaration with a direct call to syscall()
      because _syscallX() macros don't exist on IA64 (Closes: #245817).
  * debian/menu:
    + Quoted strings where appropriate.

beast (0.5.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    + Use --enable-osspcm and --enable-ossmidi instead of the now deprecated
      --enable-devdsp and --enable-devmidi. Fixes builds on system without a
      /dev, such as autobuilders.

beast (0.5.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    + Downgraded the debhelper build-dependency to 3.0.
  * sfi/Makefile.am:
    + Disabled the sfidl build due to a gcc ICE on Alpha that I have not yet
      been able to reproduce or narrow to a minimal testcase.

 -- Sam Hocevar (Debian packages) <sam+deb@zoy.org>  Thu, 14 Aug 2003 13:49:31 +0200

beast (0.5.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    + Build-depend on libgtk2.0-dev (>= 2.2.2-2) to fix the ARM build (See
      #201443 for more information).
    + Set the beast build-conflict to (<< ${Source-Version}).
  * Removed deprecated changes from the diff.
  * Re-ran "libtoolize -c -f && aclocal-1.4 && autoheader && autoconf && \
    automake-1.4" with the latest libtool (1.5) so that our C++ kludge is no
    longer needed.

 -- Sam Hocevar (Debian packages) <sam+deb@zoy.org>  Fri,  8 Aug 2003 09:57:11 +0200

beast (0.5.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

beast (0.5.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    + Build-depend on guile-1.6 (>= 1.6.4-2.1) to avoid build failures on ia64.
  * bse/bsestorage.c, sfi/testsfi.c:
    + Include <signal.h> because G_BREAKPOINT needs it on !i386 && !alpha.

 -- Sam Hocevar (Debian packages) <sam+deb@zoy.org>  Mon,  7 Jul 2003 15:33:15 +0200

beast (0.5.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Supports unlimited Undo/Redo.
    + Most Debian compilation fixes were merged.
  * aclocal-1.4 && autoconf && autoheader && automake-1.4 -a -c
  * debian/control:
    + Set the Guile build-dependency to guile-1.6-dev only, because upstream
      now officially supports it, and because it now builds on all Debian
      architectures.
    + Build-conflicts with beast (<< 0.5.3-1) so that libtool does not get
      confused with our old libbsw.

 -- Sam Hocevar (Debian packages) <sam+deb@zoy.org>  Sun,  6 Jul 2003 13:55:35 +0200

beast (0.5.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    + Updated the package description with a suggestion from upstream.
    + Explicitely depend on libglib2.0-dev (>= 2.2.2-1) because of bug #198077
      in glib2.0 that caused the hppa build to hang (Closes: #196693).
  * debian/rules:
    + Split the build target into configure and build.
    + Re-enabled optimizations on hppa that were disabled in a previous NMU,
      because this is not how it should be done.
    + On ia64, we build gslfft.c with -O1 instead of -O3 to work around a
      gcc-3.3 ICE (GCC Bug #10681).
  * Disabled the documentation generation, since it is already built in the
    original tarball.
  * Replaced g_print with g_printf in zintern.c, just in case #198077
    strikes back.
  * Stored the return value of bse_type_register_static in a GType instead of
    a guint in a few places. Fixes a FTBFS and probably crashes on Alpha.

 -- Sam Hocevar (Debian packages) <sam+deb@zoy.org>  Thu, 19 Jun 2003 20:30:18 +0200

beast (0.5.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Linked libbsw and libbse against libsfi to allow prelinking these
    libraries.
  * Removed the leading "a" in the package description.

 -- Sam Hocevar (Debian packages) <sam+deb@zoy.org>  Sun,  8 Jun 2003 14:26:35 +0200

beast (0.5.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the ia64 and hppa builds by including <assert.h> in sfidl-parser.cc.
  * Explicitely put -lpthread in addition to -pthread in GLIB_LIBS and GUI_LIBS
    because libtool eats -pthread in the link phase (Bug #194774). Makes our
    libraries usable on hppa.
  * Fixed a bug in the LADSPA plugin loader that was causing crashes when
    the cmt package was installed (Closes: #189655).
  * Set policy to 3.5.10.

 -- Sam Hocevar (Debian packages) <sam+deb@zoy.org>  Wed, 30 Apr 2003 16:27:16 +0200

beast (0.5.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the guile version check in configure.in (Closes: #191346).

 -- Samuel Hocevar <sam@zoy.org>  Wed, 30 Apr 2003 16:27:16 +0200

beast (0.5.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * We conflict against cmt (<<1.15) because old versions were compiled
    with an uncompatible version of g++.
  * Commented out some x86-only code that was disabled anyway but prevented
    proper compilation on other architectures (Closes: #190423).

 -- Samuel Hocevar <sam@zoy.org>  Thu, 24 Apr 2003 05:47:09 +0200

beast (0.5.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed an outdated comment in README.Debian suggesting to use pd
    instead of beast. beast is now mature enough.
  * Changed section to gnome, according to the recent section additions.

 -- Samuel Hocevar <sam@zoy.org>  Fri, 18 Apr 2003 22:29:24 +0200

beast (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Replaced `==' with `=' in configure.in.
  * Re-added libguile9-dev to the list of conditional build dependencies,
    because it does not look like guile-1.6-dev is going to build for all
    architectures very soon.
  * Ported the code to work with both guile-1.4 and guile-1.6. Only
    `scm_long_long2big' needed to be replaced with `scm_i_long_long2big' in
    shell/bsescminterp.c.

 -- Samuel Hocevar <sam@zoy.org>  Tue, 15 Apr 2003 02:59:39 +0200

  * New upstream release.

  * Fixed format string errors in sfi/sfidl.cc.
  * bswshell was renamed to bsesh.

beast (0.4.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.
  * Wrote a more complete manpage for beast.
  * Wrote a manpage for bswshell.
  * Disabled annoying guile version checking, Build-Depends will be enough; we
    now link against the new guile 1.6.
  * Added gsl/bseconfig.h to the list of configure-generated files.
  * Updated config.guess and config.sub.
  * Re-created bse/gslmakefile.inc by hand and other script-generated files
    that didn't get distributed.
  * Re-ran aclocal && autoheader && autoconf && automake.
  * Re-ran libtoolize and hacked the local ltmain.sh so that libtool properly
    links the freeverb.so C++ plugin.
  * Removed the build dependency on autotools-dev.
  * Fixed lots of compilation warnings (Closes: #172005).
  * Fixed the prototype of beast-gtk/bststest.c:qsampler_dcache_filler().

beast (0.4.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * bse/bsemain.c (bse_init): Terminate gslconfig array with a NULL.
    Hopefully fixes #164328.
  * configure.in: Remove Pentium check (due to a typo it didn't work in
    the first place).  The Pentium timing code works only on non-SMP
    machines, and the proper way to detect those is a run-time check.
  * Switch to debhelper 4.
  * debian/rules:
    - Automatically update config.{guess,sub} from autotools-dev.
    - Remove `debug' support and enable `-g' by default.
  * Conforms to Standards version 3.5.8.

 -- Matej Vela <vela@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Feb 2003 12:50:03 +0100

beast (0.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add hacks to ./configure to ignore detection of /dev/dsp and /dev/midi
  * set bse/toyprof.c TOYPROF_PENTIUM to 0, to not to use assembler instructions.
  * Add --enable-devmidi --enable-devdsp to ./configure options.
  * The above should fix build failure (closes: #163460)

beast (0.3.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-applied the patch to configure.in. The original configure.in
    checks if OSS works, and that's not really necessary on autobuilders.
    (closes: #103835)
  * autoconf is ran on build, and removed on clean target (as it used to be).
  * build-depends on autoconf.
  * removed the unnecessary build-conflicts for libasound1-dev

beast (0.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream release for fixing problems (closes: #103076)
    thanks go to Tim Janik for backporting fixes.
  * build-deps are now fixed. (closes: #96962)
  * no longer call autoconf in debian/rules.
  * libbse-3.0 soname increased to 3
  * This is a maintenance upload. Although this package has been 
    requested to be adopted by someone, I think I should be doing the 
    packaging of this fix, since I am still the maintainer until 
    that someone actually "adopts" this package.

beast (0.3.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * calls autoconf && ./configure in the configure process of 
    debian/rules, so that I won't get into this discrepancy of 
    configure.in and configure not matching
  * Compiled fine on vore when I did it manually.
    I guess there was some mistake in the previous upload. (closes: #89304)

beast (0.3.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Unconditionally assume that OSS is available in the configure

    succeeds even when the build machine isn't able to make
    a sound. (closes: #89304)

  * bse/bsepcmdevice-alsa.c: modified so that it doesn't try to use
    asoundid.h which seems to be not available in my system.
  * configure.in acconfig.h has been modified accordingly.
  * after all that above, I found out that ALSA didn't work, and adding
    libasound1-dev into build-deps won't help anything. (closes: #89304)
