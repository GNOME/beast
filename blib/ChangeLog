	* fixed a coupole of bugs in the initial parameter/object
	implementations, after getting beast running on GObject and GValue.

	* btype.[hc]: miscellaneous B* type stuff, provide sequential
	is for B_TYPE_PARAM_* types, so code can switch() on them.

	* bmain.[hc]: BLib initialization.

Fri Apr  7 04:27:49 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* glib-gobject.[hc]: completed parameter set/get implementations,
	along with asyncronous parameter changed notification queue.

Mon Apr  2 02:07:55 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bparam.[hc]: BParamSpec implementations, some of them are just
	simple extensions of the GLib parameter specifications.

Sun Apr  2 04:54:36 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* glib-includes.h: mangle GLib extension files together.

	* glib-gobject.[hc]: GObject implementation, that is facilities
	for setting/getting quarked data and reference counting.

	* glib-gparamspecs.[hc]: first actuall parameter implementations
	for GLib, so far we have: char, uchar, bool, int, uint, long,
	ulong, enum, flags, float, double, string and object. each of these
	GParamSpecs is a new instantiatable type in its own respect,
	so the .c file derives 13 new types from G_TYPE_PARAM and
	defines over 50 (*2) conversion facilities.

	* glib-gvaluecollector.h: generic varargs handling stubs for
	GParamSpecs, private header file (does get installed for
	inclusion into user code though).

	* glib-gvalue.[hc]: GValue functionality implementation.

	* glib-gparam.[hc]: basis GParamSpec implementation for
	the virtual base type G_TYPE_PARAM.

        * glib-genums.[hc]: enum/flags type implementation, based on
	bseenum.[hc].

	* glib-extra.[hc]: GLib additions, including 1.3 compatibility
	routines and various other functions, from string manipulation
	over list manipulation up to a unix signal GSource.

	* glib-gtype.[hc]: GLib Type System implementation, heavily
	based on BSE's dynamic type system.

Thu Mar 30 17:34:58 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* blib.h: global include file for libblib

	* blibconfig.h.in: provide general version number and
	version checking macros.
