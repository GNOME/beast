For the sake of completeness, and for curious readers, we're
keeping
@uref{beast-doc://oldnews,,old website news}.

In March 2000 we started a contest to find a logo for BEAST, and beyond
the actually selected logo, we also got a number of other interesting
submissions, which can still be found on the
@uref{beast-doc://logo-submissions/,,logo submissions} page.
