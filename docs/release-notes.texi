@unnumbered RELEASE-NOTES

@keepspaceSTART
		Much has changed in the new development series (v0.4) of BEAST.
		In brief (specifics can be found in the @uref{beast-doc://news,,NEWS section}), the
		GUI was majorly polished, many new synthesis features have
		been added and support for various external wave file formats
		was implemented.
@keepspaceEND

@keepspaceSTART
		The current version is already good enough to perform
		interesting synthesis tasks and to have lots of fun with
		songs, external MIDI devices and samples.
		However, this is still an ALPHA version, so things might
		not always work as expected, reports about misbehaviour
		are welcome.
@keepspaceEND

@keepspaceSTART
		Be warned though, the .bse file format hasn't fully stabelized
		yet, so incompatibilities whith future versions may occour.
@keepspaceEND

@keepspaceSTART
		A good starting point are the test files shipped in the
		tests/ subdirectory of the source package, or the Quick Start
		Guide in the Help menu.
