@unnumbered @center RELEASE-NOTES

This new development series of BEAST comes with a lot of the internals
redone, many new GUI features and a sound generation
back-end separated from any GUI activities.
Specifics can be found in the
@uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section}.

The most outstanding new features are the track editor which allowes
for easy selection of synthesizers or samples as track sources, loop
support and unlimited UnDo/ReDo capabilities.

NOTE: The .bse file format hasn't fully stabilized yet, so
incompatibilities with future versions may occur, though we're
making every possible attempt to maintain backwards compatibility.

A good starting point are the test files shipped in the
@path{tests/} subdirectory of the source package, or the
@uref{beast-doc://quickstart,,Quick Start Guide} in the
@menupath{Help} menu.
