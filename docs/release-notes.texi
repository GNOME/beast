@unnumbered RELEASE-NOTES

@displaySTART
Much has changed in the new development series (v0.4) of BEAST.
In brief (specifics can be found in the @uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section}), the
GUI was majorly polished, many new synthesis features have
been added and support for various external wave file formats
was implemented.
@displayEND

@displaySTART
The current version is already good enough to perform
interesting synthesis tasks and to have lots of fun with
songs, external MIDI devices and samples.
However, this is still an ALPHA version, so things might
not always work as expected, reports about misbehaviour
are welcome.
@displayEND

@displaySTART
Be warned though, the .bse file format hasn't fully stabelized
yet, so incompatibilities whith future versions may occour.
@displayEND

@displaySTART
A good starting point are the test files shipped in the
tests/ subdirectory of the source package, or the Quick Start
Guide in the Help menu.
