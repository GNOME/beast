Bse Chunk
=========
A BseChunk contains header informations for sample value blocks passed
around during sound processing, and a pointer to the associated sample
data itself. The pure sample data blocks are referred to as "Hunk"s.
A hunk's size is determined by the size of each sample value: sizeof
(BseSampleValue), the number of tracks contained in a hunk (for instance
a stereo hunk contains 2 tracks) and a global variable that designates
the block size (hunk) size for the current sound processing run:
bse_globals->hunk_length.
The sample values themselves are layed out intermixed within the hunk,
e.g. a 2 track stereo hunk with a hunk_length of 16 would contain:
L - left track (1)
R - right track (2)
LRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLR
Each chunk is associated with a certain output channel of a specific source,
and applies to a distinct time frame. The actuall time frame length is
determined through bse_globals->hunk_length and the current mixing frequency
bse_globals->mixing_freq.

BSE Sources
===========
(see also bse-ep-net.txt)
Each source can have an (conceptually) infinite amount of input channels and
serve an EPNet with multiple output channels.
Per source, a list of input channels is kept (source pointer and output
channel id, along with an associated history hint). Sources also keep back
links to other sources using its output channels, this is required to maintain
automated history updates and purging.
