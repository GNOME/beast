@unnumbered What are @beast{} and @bse{}?

@beast (the Bedevilled Audio System) is a GTK+/GNOME based front-end to @bse
(the Bedevilled Sound Engine).
@bse is a shared library that comes with the necessary framework to simulate
audio synthesis (modular synthesis) in realtime and allow for song composition.
@beast and @bse are provided under the terms of the
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html,, GNU General Public License}.

@beast is currently in development stage, the @bse API has not fully stabelized yet.
The rough goal of this project is to get an audio system that supports multiple
song and sample formats (besides the newly introduced @code{.bse} format) as well
as synthesis networks and allows full fledged editing and manipulation of them.
Sample manipulation includes generation of new sounds from module networks,
based on various forms of audio synthesis.

You may want to check out the @uref{beast-doc://screenshots/index,, screenshots} page to get an
idea of how it looks like.

For a summary from a conversation with the developer, see this
