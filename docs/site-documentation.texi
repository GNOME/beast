@unnumbered Synthesis

@beast comes with a very basic synthesis tutorial about how
to get synthesis going for new users, the
@uref{beast-doc://quickstart,, BEAST/BSE Quick Start Guide}.

Tutorials and documentation about audio synthesis in general is
currently not covered by @beast or this website, we've collected
a number of interesting links to articles on this subject in the
@uref{beast-doc://links-synthesis,, Synthesis Links}
section however.


@unnumbered Development with @beastbse

With the development release 0.4.1, @bse added support for the
@uref{http://www.gnu.org,, GNU} extension language
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html,, Guile} and
since can be scripted in Scheme.

The
@uref{beast-man://3/bse-procs,, procedure} and
@uref{beast-man://3/bse-structs,, structure} references
cover the supported interfaces to access @bse functionality from C or
Scheme.

For C specifically,
@uref{beast-man://3/sfi,, SFI} provides the necessary
@uref{http://gtk.org,, GLib} based framework to deal with
threads, notes, parameters (properties), records, sequences, time stamps
and generic values. Users of SFI will probably also appreciate the
@uref{http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/,, GLib and GObject API Reference}.
