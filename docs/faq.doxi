@section Introduction

@subsection Authors
The main author of @beastbse is Tim Janik.
A list of the various contributions is given in the
About box of @beast.

@subsection Document History
This FAQ was written by @uri{mailto://timj@@beast.testbit.eu, Tim Janik}.
Initial markup was done by Dave Seidel, until
@uri{mailto://dirt@@gtk.org, Alper Ersoy} implemented
a new markup parser for @beast documentation. Around the
0.4.1 release, the docs got migrated to texinfo format.
After the 0.6.6 release, the documentation system was rewritten, so
all docs inclusing the FAQ got migrated to doxer format.

@section Questions & Answers

@subsection Why do I get "Cannot access memory at address 0x706f6e6d" when running @beast in gdb?
Some versions of gdb have problems figuring dynamic plugins, we can only hope
that this is going to be fixed some time soon. Newer versions of gdb may
already figure what's going on with the plugins if you simply restart @beast
within gdb.
@* @important{UPDATE:} This problem has not been reproduced with gdb versions newer than 5.

@subsection Why doesn't my synthesis network produce any sound?
There are various possible causes for this. First, make sure you have
@beast correctly installed and accessing your sound card by running
one of the synthesis tests in the ./test/ subdirectory.
For custom synthesis networks, make sure you have something noisy (e.g.
the audio output of an oscillator) hooked up to a PcmOutput module, and
have the network's "Auto Activate" parameter (on it's "Parameters"
notebook page, section "Playback Settings") enabled.

@subsection Why can't I get the synthesis networks to work?
This is probably a plugin loading problem, most synthesis networks
require plugins and won't work if there are any problems loading/finding
them.
@beast loads its plugins from some common installation directory. It therefore
needs to be properly installed before you can make use of its plugins. Simply
starting it from within the build directory is not sufficient.

@subsection Why do I see @code{BEAST-WARNING **: strange, can't find any plugins, please check .../plugins} on startup?
See previous item.

@subsection Why can't I get @beast to load my .mp3, .aiff, .something sample files?
Import functionality for foreign sample types is always being worked on, but due
to the sheer multitude of formats out there chances are that a specific format
is not yet supported.
However, sample file loaders have much improved in the last versions, and at
this point exist for Ogg/Vorbis, MPEG Audio 1.0/2.0/2.5 Layer I/II/III,
RIFF/WAVE, and .bsewave (@bse multi sample format) files.

@subsection Why does @beast sometimes crash with a segmentation fault on startup?
This was due to a bug in the X Keyboard extension. @beast tries to figure the
country specifics of the keyboard layout, using the XKB extension. Apparently,
there are some allocation problems in XkbFreeKeyboard() or XkbFreeClientMap()
in libX11, which can cause random crashes. Usually @beast will run fine when
restarted.
@* @strong{UPDATE:} Recent versions of XKB seem to have fixed this problem.

@subsection Why doesn't @beast 0.4.0 play songs from earlier versions?
The song support was completely rewritten for this version. If lots of
compatiblity problem reports occur, a converter might be implemented
at some point.

@anchor{bse-file}
@subsection What is a @code{.bse} file?

@beast stores saved data in @bse files. These files can hold
everything associated with a project, such as the definition of
synthesis networks, songs with their notes and tracks, and even complete music
sample files. Except for raw sample data, the contents are stored
in a human readable text form using lisp syntax. The textual file
contents may even be manually edited, as long as the binary
appendix used to store wave data doesn't get corrupted.
@*
The recommended mime type image for @bse files looks like this:
@image{bse-mime,,,BSE-Mime-Logo,png}

@anchor{beast-hardware-requirements}
@subsection What are the minimum hardware requirements for @beast{}?

This depends a lot on how you utilise @beast{}.  If you simply want to
create synthesis networks or very simple songs, any Pentium II ought to
suffice. If you want to lay down a few tracks with effects you may need
something more modern like a CPU with 1 GHz or higher core frequency.

@anchor{gnome-canvas-idle-id-crash}
@subsection @beast crashes upon creation of new synthesis networks?

@beast uses the
@uri{ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libgnomecanvas/, GnomeCanvas Library}
to display synthesis networks. That library has a malicious redrawing bug
in versions up to (including) 2.2.0.1 triggering an assertion if the code
is compiled with debugging output, which looks like:

@code{GnomeCanvas-ERROR **: file gnome-canvas.c: line 3509 (gnome_canvas_request_update_real): assertion failed: (canvas->idle_id != 0)@*
aborting...}

This issue got fixed with version 2.2.0.2, so users encountering crashes
with @beast upon creation of synthesis networks will need to upgrade
their GnomeCanvas Library to at least 2.2.0.2.

@anchor{midi-howto}
@subsection How do i get MIDI to work?

@beast comes with a @file{test/midi-test.bse} file in the @file{test/} directory
of recent releases, it works out of the box with properly setup MIDI drivers
and MIDI pianos. Setting up MIDI drivers can be a tough task on its own but is
beyond the scope of this FAQ and is already taken care of by
@uri{http://www.midi-howto.com/, The Linux MIDI-HOWTO},
which provides good descriptions and further links to related documentation.

@anchor{c++-weakness}
@subsection GCC/G++ crashes or leaks or hangs when compiling @beast

Recent versions of @beast make use of C++ templates pretty heavily.
This allowes us to greatly simplify some code portions (for instance
the plugin implementations), but it's also a stress-test for the
compilers out there. So people encountering problems compiling C++ code
in @beast should try to upgrade their compilers as a first meassure.

@anchor{hard-output-limiting}
@subsection Unwanted signal distortion when using multiple tracks

The signal output of a song's tracks in @beast are added up before they are
routed to the sound output driver. If this added-up signal exceeds the maximum
amplitude supported by the output driver (usually the machine's sound card),
the output values are clipped to the supported range, causing the audio signal to
encounter distortion of varying amounts, depending on the signal utilization
of the channels.
In the current version (0.6.2), the distortion can be circumvented by adding a
post-processing network to songs which attenuates the incoming signals (left and
right). The Quick Start Guide has a section detailing the setup of postprocessing
networks.
For future versions, a mixer is already in development, which will allow to
handle this situation in much more flexible and adequate ways.

@subsection What platforms are supported?

Beast is mainly developed under Linux and has been ported to some BSD versions.
The @uri{http://beast.testbit.eu/download, Download page} of the Beast website links
to the available packages and source code repositories for the various supported
Linux and BSD variants.

Some effort also went into a Windows port, more details about the state of which
can be found on the @uri{http://beast.testbit.eu/wiki:WindowsPort, Windows port wiki page}.

Other operating systems are currently not supported, but the project is always taking
patches and looks for new volounteers. So to start a new port, simply write your patch
and contact the @uri{http://beast.testbit.eu/contact, mailing list and developers}.

@subsection Why does nothing happen on @emph{Play}?

If correctly installed, @beast should play the demo song from the Demo-menu out of the
box, unless it cannot acquire a suitable PCM device.
To debug PCM problem causes, the following can be used:

@code{$ beast --bse-debug=pcm}

This can produce message like the following:

@code{beast-0.7.1[999]:BSE-ALSA:1: ALSA: opening PCM "hw:0,0" readable=1 writable=1: Device or resource busy}

This is an indication that you have other audio programs (players or sound servers)
which currently access your PCM device and block it for @beast. Stopping or closing
the other applications should free the audio device for use by @beast.

@code{beast-0.7.1[26493]:BSE-ALSA:1: ALSA: opening PCM "hw:0,0" readable=0 writable=1: Failed to configure device frequency}

This one is a bit more tricky. Some ALSA drivers only allow very specific playback rates
to be used by audio applications. @beast uses the playback rate specified in the user
preferences which comes with plausible defaults upon installation.
If you see this message, try to adjust the "Synth Mixing Frequency" on the "BSE" page of
the Edit/Preferences dialog.
