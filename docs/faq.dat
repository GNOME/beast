General|Why do I get "Cannot access memory at address 0x706f6e6d" when running BEAST in gdb?|Some versions of gdb have problems figuring dynamic plugins, we can only hope that this is going to be fixed some time soon. Newer versions of gdb may already figure what's going on with the plugins if you simply restart BEAST within gdb.
General|Why can't I get the synthesis networks to work?|BEAST loads its plugins from some common installation directory. It therefore needs to be properly installed before you can make use of its plugins. Simply starting it from within the built directory is not sufficient.
General|Why does loading of ./test/osc-test.bse fail?|See previous item.
General|Why do I see "BEAST-WARNING **: strange, can't find any plugins, please check .../plugins" on startup?|See previous item.
General|Why can't I get BEAST to load my .wav, .aiff, .something sample files?|Import functionality for foreign sample types is currently being worked on, if you'd like to assist this process, send email to beast@beast.gtk.org.
General|Why does BEAST sometimes crashes with a segmentation fault on startup?|This is due to a bug in the X Keyboard extension. BEAST tries to figure the country specifics of the keyboard layout, using the XKB extension. Apparently, there are some allocation problems in XkbFreeKeyboard() or XkbFreeClientMap() in libX11, which can cause random crashes. Usually BEAST will run fine when restarted.
