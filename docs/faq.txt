1) Upon startup, BEAST sometimes crashes with a segmentation fault

  This is due to a bug in the X Keyboard extension. BEAST tries to figure
  the country specifics of the keyboard layout, using the XKB extension.
  Aparently, there are some allocation problems in XkbFreeKeyboard() or
  XkbFreeClientMap() in libX11, which can cause random crashes.
  Usually BEAST will run fine when restarted.

2) I get "Cannot access memory at address 0x706f6e6d" when running BEAST in gdb

  Some versions of gdb have problems figuring dynamic plugins, we can only
  hope that this is going to be fixed some time soon. Newer versions of gdb
  may already figure what's going on with the plugins if you simply restart
  BEAST within gdb.

3) I can't get the synthesis networks to work /
   Loading of ./test/osc-test.bse fails / Upon startup i get:
   BEAST-WARNING **: strange, can't find any plugins, please check .../plugins

  BEAST loads its plugins from some common installation directory, it
  therefore needs to be properly installed before you can make use of
  its plugins, simply starting it from within the built directory is not
  sufficient.

4) I can't get BEAST to load my .wav, .aiff, .something sample files

  Import functionality for foreign sample types is currently being worked
  on, if you'd like to assist this process, send email to beast@beast.gtk.org.
