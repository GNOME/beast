1) Upon startup, BEAST sometimes crashes with a segmentation fault

  This is due to a bug in the X Keyboard extension. BEAST tries to figure
  the country specifics of the keyboard layout, using the XKB extension.
  Aparently, there are some allocation problems in XkbFreeKeyboard() or
  XkbFreeClientMap() in libX11, which can cause random crashes.
  Usually BEAST will run fine when restarted.

2) I get "Cannot access memory at address 0x706f6e6d" when running BEAST in gdb

  Some versions of gdb have problems figuring dynamic plugins, we can only
  hope that this is going to be fixed some time soon.
