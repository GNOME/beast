Q: I get "Cannot access memory at address 0x706f6e6d" when running BEAST in gdb

A: Some versions of gdb have problems figuring dynamic plugins, we can only
   hope that this is going to be fixed some time soon. Newer versions of gdb
   may already figure what's going on with the plugins if you simply restart
   BEAST within gdb.


Q: I can't get the synthesis networks to work
Q: Loading of ./test/osc-test.bse or other synthesis networks always fails
Q: Upon startup i get:
   BEAST-WARNING **: strange, can't find any plugins, please check .../plugins

A: BEAST loads its plugins from some common installation directory, it
   therefore needs to be properly installed before you are able to make use of
   its plugins, simply starting it from within the build directory is not
   sufficient.


Q: I can't get BEAST to load my .wav, .aiff, .something sample files

A: Import functionality for foreign sample types is currently being worked
   on, if you'd like to assist this process, send email to beast@beast.gtk.org.


Q: Upon startup, BEAST sometimes crashes with a segmentation fault

A: This is due to a bug in the X Keyboard extension. BEAST tries to figure
   the country specifics of the keyboard layout, using the XKB extension.
   Aparently, there are some allocation problems in XkbFreeKeyboard() or
   XkbFreeClientMap() in libX11, which can cause random crashes.
   Usually BEAST will run fine when restarted.
