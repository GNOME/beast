BSE Effect Processor Nets
=========================

A BSE Effect Processor Net (EPNet) is an accumulation of BseSources
that are interconnected to controll sample data flow.
The net as a whole is maintained by a BseEPNet object which keeps
references of all sources contained in the net and provides means
to store/retrive undo/redo information for the whole net and implements
the corresponding requirements to save and load the complete net at a
certain configuration.

Implementation details:
-	a BseEPNet keeps a list and references of all sources contained
	in the net.
-	each source can have an (conceptually) infinite amount of input
	channels and serve the net with multiple output channels.
-	per source, a list of input channels is kept (source pointer plus
	output channel id, along with an associated history hint).
-	sources also keep back links to sources using its output channels,
	this is required to maintain automated history updates.
