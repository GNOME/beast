@unnumbered @center RELEASE-NOTES

This new development series of BEAST comes with a lot of
the internals redone, many new GUI features and a sound generation
back-end separated from any GUI activities.
Specifics can be found in the
@uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section}).

The most outstanding new feature is the track editor which allows
free arrangement of parts in songs and adds loop support to
simplify song edits.

Be warned though, the .bse file format hasn't completely stabilized
yet, so incompatibilities with future versions may occur.

A good starting point are the test files shipped in the
@path{tests/} subdirectory of the source package, or the
@uref{beast-doc://quickstart,,Quick Start Guide} in the
@menupath{Help} menu.
