@unnumbered @center RELEASE-NOTES

Much has changed in the new development series (v0.4) of BEAST.
In brief (specifics can be found in the
@uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section}), the
GUI was majorly polished, many new synthesis features have
been added and support for various external wave file formats
was implemented.

The current version allows to perform interesting synthesis tasks
and to have lots of fun with songs, external MIDI devices and samples.
However, since this is still an ALPHA version, some things might
break on occasions, so reports about misbehaviour are welcome.

Be warned though, the .bse file format hasn't fully stabelized
yet, so incompatibilities whith future versions may occour.

A good starting point are the test files shipped in the
@path{tests/} subdirectory of the source package, or the
@uref{beast-doc://quickstart,,Quick Start Guide} in the @menupath{Help} menu.
