@unnumbered What's New?


@news_title{Tuesday 31 Dec 2002, Ongoing Work}

The CVS tree has undergone major shuffeling recently due to integration of a
new middleware layer into BSE. In other news, our website maintainer
@uref{mailto://dirt@@gtk.org,,Alper Ersoy} is working hard on a new
website layout which is why we haven't had much site updating in the last
couple weeks.

We expect to switch web presence over anytime soon, so stay tuned for a new
look and much improved content.


@news_title{Monday 2 Sep 2002, New Development Release}

BEAST/BSE version 0.4.1 is available in the
@uref{beast-doc://download,,download section}.

Much has changed in the new development version of BEAST.
In brief (specifics can be found in the NEWS section), the
GUI was majorly polished, many new synthesis features have
been added and support for various external wave file formats
was implemented.@*
The current version is already good enough to perform
interesting synthesis tasks and to have lots of fun with
songs, external MIDI devices and samples.
However, this is still an ALPHA version, so things might
not always work as expected, reports about misbehaviour
are welcome.@*
Be warned though, the .bse file format hasn't fully stabelized
yet, so incompatibilities whith future versions may occour.

A good starting point are the test files shipped in the
@path{tests/} subdirectory of the source package or the new
Quick Start Guide in the Help menu.
