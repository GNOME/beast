@uref{beast-doc://download,,download section}, here is the
@uref{http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1050,,FootNotes announcement}.

The most exciting new feature in this release is the support for
@uref{http://www.ladspa.org/,, LADSPA} plugins. With that, @beast
gains support for a wide variety of excellent plugins available on
the net, for instance the
@uref{http://plugin.org.uk/,,plugin collection from Steve Harris}.

@uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section}.

@newsTitle{Thursday 13 Mar 2003, New Development Release}

BEAST/BSE version 0.5.0 is available in the
@uref{beast-doc://download,,download section}, here is the
@uref{http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=993,,FootNotes announcement}.

This new development series of BEAST comes with a lot of
the internals redone, many new GUI features and a sound
generation back-end separated from any GUI activities.
The most outstanding new feature is the track editor which
allows free arrangement of parts in songs and adds loop
support to simplify song edits.
