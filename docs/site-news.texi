@unnumbered What's New?


@newsTitle{Thursday 27 February 2003, LinuxForum 2003}

Stefan Westerfeld and Tim Janik are going to the
@uref{http://www.linuxforum.dk,,Linux Forum 2003} this Saturday
(1 March). We'll probably hang out at the debian booth if people
want to catch us to talk about @beast{},
@uref{http://www.arts-project.org,,aRts} or
@uref{http://sfk.evilplan.org/csl/,,CSL}.


@newsTitle{Friday 21 February 2003, Recent Development}

Lots of website content has been improved recently. The
@uref{beast-doc://historic,, Historic} section got updated,
and thanks to Alper Ersoys continued work on the documentation
system, the constantly evolving
@uref{beast-doc://documentation,, Reference} and
@uref{beast-doc://development,, Development} docs now support
function, structure and external API links.

In actual program development, Stefan Westerfeld has hacked up
a new @beast backend, supporting PCM output through
@uref{http://sfk.evilplan.org/csl/,,CSL}, so
@beast can now benefit from CSLs sound server support.
Also, there's a new track editor widget developing in CVS,
enabling more complex arrangements of songs. We'll post
screenshots of the new widget as soon as its GUI has
matured a bit. For the curious,
@uref{beast-doc://release-news,, NEWS} has more details
about development highlights in the upcoming 0.4.2
release.


@newsTitle{Saturday 11 January 2003, Website Switch}

The new website is up, finally! Many thanks go to
@uref{mailto://dirt@@gtk.org,,Alper Ersoy} for his continued efford to set
the site up. The new site has a completely redone layout, improved structure
and a lot more content.

So browse and enjoy! ;-)
