@newsTitle{Sunday 20 Apr 2003, BEAST-0.5.1 patch fixed}

The @beast patch to update from version 0.5.0 to 0.5.1 unfortunately
missed an image file (due to it being detected as binary by diff),
causing the 0.5.1 build to fail for some users. We've put up a new
patch as
@uref{http://beast.gtk.org/beast-ftp/v0.5/patch-beast-0.5.0-0.5.1.fixed.gz,,patch-beast-0.5.0-0.5.1.fixed.gz}
now, which contains the missing file and correctly updates from 0.5.0 to
@uref{http://beast.gtk.org/beast-ftp/v0.5/beast-0.5.1.tar.gz,,beast-0.5.1.tar.gz}.
We apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused.

On a related topic, many users encountered crashes upon creation of synthesis
networks with the newer versions, there is now a
@uref{beast-doc://faq#gnome-canvas-idle-id-crash,,FAQ entry}
adressing the specifics of the issue.


@newsTitle{Monday 14 Apr 2003, BEAST Featuring LADSPA}

BEAST/BSE version 0.5.1 is available in the
@uref{beast-doc://download,,download section}, here is the
@uref{http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1050,,FootNotes announcement}.

The most exciting new feature in this release is the support for
@uref{http://www.ladspa.org/,, LADSPA} plugins. With that, @beast
gains support for a wide variety of excellent plugins available on
the net, for instance the
@uref{http://plugin.org.uk/,,plugin collection from Steve Harris}.

As usual, more release details are outlined in the
@uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section}.


@newsTitle{Wednesday 19 Mar 2003, List move and site updates}

The @beast mailing list has moved. People may subscribe to the
new list at @uref{http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/beast/}
now, or just read the archives at @uref{http://mail.gnome.org/archives/beast/}.
Also, the @uref{beast-doc://links-synthesis,, link section}
has been updated, and we got new or updated screen shots
(amongst them the new track editor) in the
@uref{beast-doc://screenshots/index,,screen shot area}.
