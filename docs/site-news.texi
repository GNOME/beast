@newsTitle{Saturday 21 Jun 2003, The i-didn't-mean-to Realease}

BEAST/BSE version 0.5.2 is available in the
@uref{beast-doc://download,,download section}.
@c , here is the
@c @uref{http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1050,,FootNotes announcement}.

With this release, @beast allowes to gracefully backup from erroneous
user actions, by offering unlimited Undo/Redo facilities for all operations.
Other highlights are greatly simplified sample and synthesizer
selection for tracks and WAV recording abilities.

As usual, more release details are outlined in the
@uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section}.


@newsTitle{Sunday 20 Apr 2003, BEAST-0.5.1 patch fixed}

The @beast patch to update from version 0.5.0 to 0.5.1 unfortunately
missed an image file (due to it being detected as binary by diff),
causing the 0.5.1 build to fail for some users. We've put up a new
patch as
@uref{http://beast.gtk.org/beast-ftp/v0.5/patch-beast-0.5.0-0.5.1.fixed.gz,,patch-beast-0.5.0-0.5.1.fixed.gz}
now, which contains the missing file and correctly updates from 0.5.0 to
@uref{http://beast.gtk.org/beast-ftp/v0.5/beast-0.5.1.tar.gz,,beast-0.5.1.tar.gz}.
We apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused.

On a related topic, many users encountered crashes upon creation of synthesis
networks with the newer versions, there is now a
@uref{beast-doc://faq#gnome-canvas-idle-id-crash,,FAQ entry}
adressing the specifics of the issue.


@newsTitle{Monday 14 Apr 2003, BEAST Featuring LADSPA}

BEAST/BSE version 0.5.1 is available in the
@uref{beast-doc://download,,download section}, here is the
@uref{http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1050,,FootNotes announcement}.

The most exciting new feature in this release is the support for
@uref{http://www.ladspa.org/,, LADSPA} plugins. With that, @beast
gains support for a wide variety of excellent plugins available on
the net, for instance the
@uref{http://plugin.org.uk/,,plugin collection from Steve Harris}.

As usual, more release details are outlined in the
@uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section}.
