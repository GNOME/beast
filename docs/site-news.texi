@* BEAST patch:

It took a long time to get this release out, but the new features and the bug fixes
are definitely worth it! As usual, we've had lots of language updates, many GUI
fixes, but also some critical stability fixes. Major new features are: a stereo mixer
for songs, DB meters, MIDI automation and a new sample-and-hold module by Artem Popov.
As always, the
@uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section} has the exact changes, enjoy the new code and
please report bugs to our
@uref{http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/beast/,, mailing list}.


@newsTitle{Wednesday 07 Jul 2004, The ``small but steady steps'' Release}

BEAST/BSE version 0.6.2 is available from the
@uref{beast-doc://download,,download section},
here is the @uref{http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1870,,FootNotes announcement}.

Tarball:
@uref{http://beast.gtk.org/beast-ftp/v0.6/beast-0.6.2.tar.gz,, beast-0.6.2.tar.gz}

@uref{http://beast.gtk.org/beast-ftp/v0.6/patch-beast-0.6.1-0.6.2.bz2,, patch-beast-0.6.1-0.6.2.bz2}.

Lots of tiny but important details got fixed in this release. @beast also had a lot of
language translation updates, and supports more fine grained note quantization and note lengths.
Behind the scenes, there's also been some more infrastructure work, the results of which aren't
going to surface before another releases or two though.
As always, the
@uref{beast-doc://release-news,,NEWS section} has the exact changes, enjoy the new code and
please report bugs to our
