Why do I get "Cannot access memory at address 0x706f6e6d" when running BEAST in gdb?
@FAQ-ANSWER@
Some versions of gdb have problems figuring dynamic plugins, we can only hope
that this is going to be fixed some time soon. Newer versions of gdb may
already figure what's going on with the plugins if you simply restart BEAST
within gdb. @NL@
UPDATE: This problem hasn't yet been reproduced with gdb versions newer than 5.

Why can't I get the synthesis networks to work?
@FAQ-ANSWER@
BEAST loads its plugins from some common installation directory. It therefore
needs to be properly installed before you can make use of its plugins. Simply
starting it from within the built directory is not sufficient.

Why can't I get BEAST to load my .mp3, .aiff, .something sample files?
@FAQ-ANSWER@
Import functionality for foreign sample types is currently being worked on, if
you'd like to assist this process, send email to beast@beast.gtk.org.
Wave file loaders currently exist for Ogg/Vorbis and .wav files.

@FAQ-TITLE@
Why does BEAST sometimes crash with a segmentation fault on startup?
@FAQ-ANSWER@
This was due to a bug in the X Keyboard extension. BEAST tries to figure the
country specifics of the keyboard layout, using the XKB extension. Apparently,
there are some allocation problems in XkbFreeKeyboard() or XkbFreeClientMap()
in libX11, which can cause random crashes. Usually BEAST will run fine when
restarted. @NL@
UPDATE: Recent versions of XKB seem to have fixed this problem.

@FAQ-TITLE@
Why doesn't BEAST 0.4.0 play songs from earlier versions?
@FAQ-ANSWER@
The song support was completely rewritten for this version. If lots of
compatiblity problem reports occour, a converter might be implemented at some point.
