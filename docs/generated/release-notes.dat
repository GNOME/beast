				RELEASE-NOTES
				=============

	Much has changed in the new development version of BEAST.
	In brief (specifics can be found in the NEWS section), the
	GUI was majorly polished, many new synthesis features have
	been added and support for various external wave file formats
	was implemented.
	The current version is already good enough to perform
	interesting synthesis tasks and to have lots of fun with
	songs, external MIDI devices and samples ;)
	However, this is still an ALPHA version, so things might
	not always work as expected, reports about misbehaviour
	are welcome.
	Be warned though, the .bse file format hasn't fully stabelized
	yet, so incompatibilities whith future versions may occour.
	
	A good starting point are the test files shipped in the
	tests/ subdirectory of the source package.
