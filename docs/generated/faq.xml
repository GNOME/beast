Initial markup was done by Dave Seidel, until <uref><urefurl>dirt@gtk.org</urefurl><urefdesc>Alper Ersoy</urefdesc></uref> implemented a new markup parser for <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> documentation. Around the 0.4.1 release, the docs got migrated to texinfo format.</para></section> <section> <title>Contact Information and Resources</title> <itemize> <itemfunction>&bullet;</itemfunction> <item> <para>WWW: <uref><urefurl>http://beast.gtk.org</urefurl></uref></para></item> <item> <para>FTP: <uref><urefurl>ftp://beast.gtk.org/pub/beast</urefurl></uref></para></item> <item> <para>Mailing List: <uref><urefurl>beast@beast.gtk.org</urefurl></uref>.

Newer versions of gdb may already figure what's going on with the plugins if you simply restart <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> within gdb. &linebreak; <strong>UPDATE:</strong> This problem hasn't yet been reproduced with gdb versions newer than 5.</para></section> <section> <title>Why doesn't my synthesis network produce any sound?</title> <para>There are various possible causes for this. First, make sure you have <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> correctly installed and accessing your sound card by running one of the synthesis tests in the ./test/ subdirectory. For custom synthesis networks, make sure you have something noisy (e.g. the audio output of an oscillator) hooked up to a PcmOutput module, and have the network's "Auto Activate" parameter (on it's "Parameters" notebook page, section "Playback Settings") enabled.</para></section> <section> <title>Why can't I get the synthesis networks to work?</title> <para>This is probably a plugin loading problem, most synthesis networks require plugins and won't work if there are any problems loading/finding them. <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> loads its plugins from some common installation directory. It therefore needs to be properly installed before you can make use of its plugins. Simply starting it from within the build directory is not sufficient.</para></section> <section> <title>Why do I see <code>BEAST-WARNING **: strange, can't find any plugins, please check .../plugins</code> on startup?</title> <para>See previous item.</para></section> <section> <title>Why can't I get <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> to load my .mp3, .aiff, .something sample files?</title> <para>Import functionality for foreign sample types is always being worked on, but due to the shear multitude of formats out there chances are that a specific format is not yet supported. However, sample file loaders have much improved in the last versions, and at this point exist for Ogg/Vorbis, MPEG Audio 1.0/2.0/2.5 Layer I/II/III, RIFF/WAVE, and .gslwave (<emphasize>GSL</emphasize> multi sample format) files.</para></section> <section> <title>Why does <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> sometimes crash with a segmentation fault on startup?</title> <para>This was due to a bug in the X Keyboard extension. <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> tries to figure the country specifics of the keyboard layout, using the XKB extension. Apparently, there are some allocation problems in XkbFreeKeyboard() or XkbFreeClientMap() in libX11, which can cause random crashes. Usually <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> will run fine when restarted. &linebreak; <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Recent versions of XKB seem to have fixed this problem.</para></section> <section> <title>Why doesn't <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> 0.4.0 play songs from earlier versions?</title> <para>The song support was completely rewritten for this version. If lots of compatiblity problem reports occur, a converter might be implemented at some point.</para></section> <section> <title>What is a <code>.bse</code> file?</title> <para><emphasize>BEAST</emphasize> stores saved data in <emphasize>BSE</emphasize> files. These files can hold everything associated with a project, such as the definition of synthesis networks, songs with their notes and tracks, and even complete music sample files. Except for raw sample data, the contents are stored in a human readable text form using lisp syntax. The textual file contents may even be manually edited, as long as the binary appendix used to store wave data doesn't get corrupted. &linebreak;</para> <para>The recommended mime type image for <emphasize>BSE</emphasize> files looks like this: <image width="" height="" alttext="BSE-Mime-Logo" extension="png">beast-mime</image></para></section> <section> <title>What are the minimum hardware requirements for <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize>?</title> <para>This depends a lot on how you utilise <emphasize>BEAST</emphasize>. If you simply want to create synthesis networks or very simple songs, any Pentium II ought to suffice. If you want to lay down a few tracks with effects you may need something more modern: a Pentium III 500MHz is recommended.</para></section></chapter></texinfo>
