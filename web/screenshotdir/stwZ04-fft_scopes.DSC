FFT Scopes allow visualization of audio signals,
which is useful for getting an impression of
the frequency spectrum that a network, effect
or instrument produces at some point. Here you see
how a Reverb Effect blurs the frequency content
(upper spectrum: without reverb, lower spectrum:
with reverb).
