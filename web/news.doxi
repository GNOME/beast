@unnumbered What's New?


@newsTitle{Saturday 11 January 2003, Website Switch}

The new website is up, finally! Many thanks go to
@uref{mailto://dirt@@gtk.org,,Alper Ersoy} for his continued efford to set
the site up. The new site has a completely redone layout, improved structure
and a lot more content.

So browse and enjoy! ;-)


@newsTitle{Tuesday 31 Dec 2002, Ongoing Work}

The CVS tree has undergone major shuffeling recently due to integration of a
new middleware layer into BSE. In other news, our website maintainer
@uref{mailto://dirt@@gtk.org,,Alper Ersoy} is working hard on a new
website layout which is why we haven't had much site updating in the last
couple weeks.

We expect to switch web presence over anytime soon, so stay tuned for a new
look and much improved content.


@bye
