@newsTitle{Monday 29 Dec 2003, intltool add-on for beast-0.5.6}

Aparently intltool 0.28 which the last beast release uses, requires a specific
perl module to be available in order to build. So for some users, the build
has been failing. If you run into build errors like:
@example
</tmp/beast-0.5.6>$ make -C data
make: Entering directory `/tmp/beast-0.5.6/data'
LC_ALL=C ../intltool-merge ../po beast.desktop.in beast.desktop -d -u -c ../po/.intltool-merge-cache
The OrigTree module doesn't seem to be properly installed ../intltool-merge
make: *** [beast.desktop] Error 2
make: Leaving directory `/tmp/beast-0.5.6/data'
@end example
you can apply this patch
@uref{http://beast.gtk.org/beast-ftp/v0.5/patch-beast-0.5.6-0.5.6+intltool.bz2,, patch-beast-0.5.6-0.5.6+intltool.bz2}
like:
@example
</tmp/beast-0.5.6>$ patch -p1 < patch-beast-0.5.6-0.5.6+intltool
patching file intltool-modules/XML/Parser/Style/OrigTree.pm
@end example
in order to supply the perl module and get intltool to work.
