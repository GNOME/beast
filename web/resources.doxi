@heading Links

We are maintaining a
@uri{@top_webdir/synthesis-links.html, collection of selected links}
to articles and other writings about audio synthesis for people
interested in reading up on the topics.

And there is of course a
@uri{@top_webdir/related-links.html, collection} of links to related
or subsidiary projects.
