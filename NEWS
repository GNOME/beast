* New threaded sound engine which can process synthesis
  modules in the background or on a seperate processor
* Many (not yet all) synthesis modules got ported to the
  new engine and got improved in quality and speed

  Ports/SubSynth  - allows synthesis network rerouting
  Constant        - constant value output module
  WaveOsc         - Anti-aliasing wave playback
  Sequencer	  - a mini sequencer for harmonic tone switches
  Amplifier	  - a VCA equivalent with featurefull control variants
* Joint (multi-connect) channel support, allowing multiple input
  connections per channel on some modules
* Major speed improvements to the threading layer by using pthreads
  directly where possible
* New 19"-rack alike GUI front-end for customized GUI presentation
  of .bse projects
* Major GUI cleanups and improvements
* Major documentation improvements
* Ported BEAST/BSE to Gtk+2.0 and GLib-2.0
* Moved the BSE type system into GLib-2.0 as GObject
* A huge amount of bug fixes

  optimized and contains all necessary means for effect
  implementations
* Synthesis tools palette for the synthesis network router and
  many other GUI improvements
* Enabled procedure support for the pattern editor to supply
  spreadsheet like editing facilities
* New synthesis modules:
  BseMixer       - mix 4->1 channels with adjustable volumes
  DavOrgan       - a modifiable Additive Organ Synthesizer
  DavSynDrum     - a synthesized drum generator
  DavCanyonDelay - adds deep, long delay echo effects
