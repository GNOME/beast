BSE Driver Package
==================

This is a BSE (Bedevilled Sound Engine) plugin/driver package.  In order to
build this package, you need recent versions of BSE (>=0.6.4) and PortAudioV19.

PortAudio (>= V19):

The official ftp site for BEAST/BSE is:
  ftp://beast.gtk.org/pub/beast

The official web site for BEAST/BSE is:

There also is a mailing list for the project (beast@gnome.org):

And a related IRC channel:
  #beast on GimpNet (irc.gimp.org:6666)

Installation
============

This package is a driver package and may install files under a prefix different
from the prefix specified at configure time.  In particular, the BSE drivers
build from this package will be installed under the drivers/. subdirectory of
an existing libbse installation. The exact installation location can be found
out via pkg-config with:

  pkg-config --variable=driverdir bse	

For general installation instructions, see the file `INSTALL'.

Known Issues with the Current Release
=====================================

* the driver doesn't yet work with the PortAudio JACK driver

  Although one of the motivations for implementing the PortAudioV19 support
  was JACK support, it turned out that I needed to use PortAudios blocking
  API for integrating with BEAST properly. You can read the discussion at
  PortAudios list archive:

  http://techweb.rfa.org/pipermail/portaudio/2004-November/003979.html

  Since the PortAudio JACK driver doesn't support blocking yet, I started to
  work on a patch against PortAudio that will fix this. It works with my
  locally modified version of PortAudio already, but I have some cleanup work
  to do before I can submit it to the PortAudio Team for merging the patch.
  
  But once this happened, this PortAudio driver will support JACK, OSS and
  ALSA. You can expect me to make the required patch against PortAudio
  publically available soon.

* you need a CVS version of PortAudioV19

  Since there is no released version of PortAudioV19, you need to grab a
  snapshot from the CVS, which can be obtained at

  http://www.portaudio.com/archives/pa_snapshot_v19.tar.gz

  This is required since we use the blocking API, and the driver list
  function, both of which were introduced at PortAudioV19.

* the driver is untested

  I only tested it here, so currently, I didn't receive user feedback. Please
  supply feedback if possible. It appears that some cards may not work when
  opened in readwrite mode through PortAudio. I didn't investigate this
  completely, but you can initialize PortAudio using

  beast -p portaudio=oss:0,wo

  to use the writeonly mode. This should definitely work.

* the default device used may not be right.

  BEAST requires the default device to be used to be listed first, but I don't
  sort according to PortAudio defaults yet. Thus if you say

  beast -p portaudio

  BEAST may or may not be using the default PortAudio driver. But for now, you
  may want to explicitely specify the driver to use, since the "default"
  option of my PortAudio driver is also not implemented correctly (it will
  probably go away in the next release anyway).

* latency for the OSS driver is not too good

  This appears to be PortAudios fault, because it doesn't initialize the
  fragment settings of OSS in the correct way. Again, I didn't investigate
  this too much, but I think PortAudio should be patched to fix this.

Please let me know any issues you have with the driver. I want to make it
stable and solid as I receive feedback. Currently, this is work in progress.
