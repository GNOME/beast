	* bsenoise.[hc]: new noise generator.

	* icons/noicon.xcf:
	* icons/noicon.c: files to be used for objects/procedures that don't
	come with their own icons but want one.

	* testos.c: we need to be *at least* of size sizeof (BseSource) if
	we want to derive from BseSource.

Sat Oct 30 07:54:26 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* testos.c: correctly prefix all obejct type names with "Bse".

Fri Oct 15 00:25:44 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* icons/Makefile.am: 
	* icons/Makefile.icons: setup ./icons subdirectory.

	(over the last few days):

	* Makefile.am: specify a logging domain and a fallback plugin
	name through preprocessor macros upon compilation.

	* added a test-object plugin to prove object-type imports are
	actually possible.

	* added ability to type registration to specify pixdata buffers
	to create icons from.

	* shuffled initialization fields for procedures so categories
	go along with (newly) specified pixdata to create icons from.
	the prefered pixdata format is actually run-length-encoded
	macro-ized output of the gimp's c-source file export.

	* testos.c: added some more testobjects, all sources. test expose
	new categories and icons.

	* Makefile.plugins: ugh, oh. all the time this file was empty and
	wouldn't get remade because of CVS stamps. now it has contents and
	actually compiles (and installs) the (test) procedure plugins.
