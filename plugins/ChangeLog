Thu Dec  9 03:56:24 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bsegenosc.c (bse_gen_osc_calc_chunk): handle amplitude modulation.

	* bseloopback.[hc]: simlpe plugin to reroute it's input to the output
	(no, no extra buffer copy is necessary).

	* removed testos.c (finally).

Sun Dec  5 02:52:29 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bsecapture.[hc]: adapted stuff to the new BsePcmDevice and BseHeart
	core objects.

Tue Nov 23 00:16:57 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bsefirfilter.[hc]: some (minor) parameter clean ups.

Sat Nov 20 23:24:25 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bsefirfilter.[hc]: started out on an FIR (finite impulse response)
	filter. it supports variable degree setting, cut off frequency,
	C. Lanczos and von Hann smoothing. only lowpass mode is implemented
	currently though.

	* bsegenosc.c (bse_gen_osc_calc_chunk): take modulo operations out
	of the inner loop.
	
	* testos.c: removed some more test code.
	
	* bsecapture.c: use the Mic icon for now.

Sat Nov 20 08:57:38 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bsegenosc.c (bse_gen_osc_set_param): added phase, base_note and
	base_freq parameters.

Sat Nov 13 20:26:45 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bsegenosc.[hc]: started out on a generic oscillator implementation.

Thu Nov 11 03:51:21 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bsenoise.c: ugh oh, a BseNoise structure amounts to sizeof (BseNoise),
	not sizeof (BseSource).

	* bsecapture.c: same here (well i copied the basic code ;).

Wed Nov 10 03:06:54 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bsecapture.[hc]: new bse source to provide recorded data.

Sun Nov  7 20:48:04 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* bsenoise.[hc]: new noise generator.

	* icons/noicon.xcf:
	* icons/noicon.c: files to be used for objects/procedures that don't
	come with their own icons but want one.

Wed Nov  3 20:55:21 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* testos.c: we need to be *at least* of size sizeof (BseSource) if
	we want to derive from BseSource.

Sat Oct 30 07:54:26 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* testos.c: correctly prefix all obejct type names with "Bse".

Fri Oct 15 00:25:44 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* icons/Makefile.am: 
	* icons/Makefile.icons: setup ./icons subdirectory.

Thu Oct 14 23:14:16 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	(over the last few days):

	* Makefile.am: specify a logging domain and a fallback plugin
	name through preprocessor macros upon compilation.

	* added a test-object plugin to prove object-type imports are
	actually possible.

	* added ability to type registration to specify pixdata buffers
	to create icons from.

	* shuffled initialization fields for procedures so categories
	go along with (newly) specified pixdata to create icons from.
	the prefered pixdata format is actually run-length-encoded
	macro-ized output of the gimp's c-source file export.

	* testos.c: added some more testobjects, all sources. test expose
	new categories and icons.

Sun Jun 27 10:11:37 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* Makefile.plugins: ugh, oh. all the time this file was empty and
	wouldn't get remade because of CVS stamps. now it has contents and
	actually compiles (and installs) the (test) procedure plugins.
